# quince — progress dashboard

**One-line state.** ⚑ **The product is FROZEN and soaking; the PROCESS REVAMP is complete through
`pr.5`, and only `pr.6` (the lockout) remains.** quince itself is unchanged since `qn.6b` landed and
its lab legs passed — hardware-proven over USB and Wi-Fi, running under real daily use on staging.
What changed is how the project is built: PRs are how agents communicate, an approval is a literal
PR approval, issues are the tracker, and branch protection is the authority model. **`pr.0`–`pr.5`
landed** — machine identity (`quince-bot`) + branch protection; this journal split out of the
product repo; `deploy/devct/` (a dev-container toolkit that builds its own template and hands out
disposable boxes on a scoped Proxmox token); the skills (`/onboard`, `/architect`, `/kickoff`,
`/report`, `/review-pr`, `/land`, `/qa`); deploy-by-default QA (`devct deploy` puts a clickable demo
URL in every PR, fetched before it is claimed); and two persistent session hosts —
**`quince-runner`** (implementer identity) and **`quince-arch`** (architect), each of whose
preflight asserts the *other's* credential is absent, so approver ≠ author is a property of machines
rather than a habit. Both now hold live Remote Control sessions.
**Owed before unfreeze:** [quince#32](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/issues/32) (the arch
service cannot start from a clean conf.d — a temporary export sits on that box),
[quince#33](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/issues/33) (three undocumented ceremony gates),
`pr.6` (every remaining root path becomes a forced-command wrapper), and
[devlog#4](https://github.com/novkostya/quince-devlog/issues/4) (the implementer half of the
review loop; the architect half has been in production for a day). **Then unfreeze**, with
[quince#9](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/issues/9) deliberately reserved as the first
post-freeze item so the whole loop gets an end-to-end dress rehearsal, and `qn.7` (Wi-Fi
auto-resume) resuming the product chain. Architect handoff notes:
[devlog#10](https://github.com/novkostya/quince-devlog/issues/10).

Prior state: **`qn.5b` was BUILT (CI-proven, 2026-07-24 (cp)).** `qn.5b` made the `latest` swap **atomic**
(`renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE)`) + reworked the per-job `working/` lifecycle unified across backends
((cg)/(co)) — `make gates`/image green; only the real-rpool lab legs (G-snapshot/G-rclone/
G-exchange-live + syncoid) remain, owned by an Operator hardware day. `qn.6a` = soak-ready UI —
**mobile is the precondition for daily use**, plus offline devices and backup-list labels ((ch)); it
is the **last rung under the current process** and feeds the revamp friction evidence. Deferred past
the freeze: gate **12c**, the DSM/alpha-tester prerequisites, the rest of qn.7, and qn.6+. **The
PROCESS REVAMP is in flight** (product code frozen, app soaking): the GitHub substrate is live —
branch protection, labels, templates, the machine account — and the journal moved to this repo
([quince#4](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/4),
[quince#5](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/5)); **pr.3 is LANDED** — the standing agent
instructions, the six workflow skills (`/onboard`, `/kickoff`, `/report`, `/review-pr`, `/land`,
`/qa`), and the layered permission allowlist
([quince#6](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/6)–[#8](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/8),
`main` at `6df2461`), so a session now self-onboards from a command instead of a hand-written
kickoff. **`pr.2` is LANDED too** — `devct`, the dev-container toolkit, in
[quince#10](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/10)–[#16](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/16):
`devct onboard` binds a machine, `devct-template build` builds a template from scratch on any
Proxmox host, and `devct create|list|destroy` hands out disposable containers that reach a green
gate ladder in ~3 minutes. **The whole permanent root surface is one four-command block at
`versions.env` cadence** — everything else runs on a scoped API token, proven from a session with
no root path at all and reproduced independently. **`pr.4` is LANDED too** — `dev-deploy`, in
[quince#17](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/17)–[#19](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/19):
`devct deploy` builds a ref's **production** image on a dev container, serves it in `--demo` mode,
and reports a URL only after fetching it (222 s cold, 5 s warm); `/report` runs it by default, `/qa`
is replaced rather than a placeholder, and the DoD names both non-URL outcomes so *not applicable*
cannot absorb *unavailable*. The deploy URL is the **convention name** — an address never enters PR
text. **`pr.5`'s CODE IS LANDED and its GATES ARE OWED** — the runner container exists, is
provisioned from a signed repository, and reports honestly that it has no session yet
([quince#21](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/21)–[#23](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/23)).
What remains is the Operator's five minutes — `claude auth login` (measured: a token credential
*cannot* establish Remote Control, so there is no headless path), workspace trust, the two `/config`
push toggles — after which G2/G3/G5/G6 become runnable, G6 being an implementer loop run entirely
*from* the runner. **Next: that ceremony**, then pr.6 (lockout), which inherits a written
constraint — the root-capable path reaches the runner only as a forced-command wrapper, never a
general root key. Recent history follows.

**`qn.4c` is BUILT + HARDWARE-PROVEN — the DAILY-DRIVER bar is MET ((cd)/(ce)).**
Both transports drive real encrypted backups from the browser on **supervised** muxers: a 33.3 GB
first-ever full backup and a cabled incremental both committed, verified and snapshotted; live
updates arrive with no page refresh; devices show their real last backup; iMazing opens a committed
`latest/` tree (which also retires qn.4a gate 15's last leg). The hardware day found — and fixed
in-session — a **gate-blocking** bug in landed qn.4a code: the backup target stub lived on the cache
filesystem, so `idevicebackup2` reported the wrong free space and the DEVICE refused any backup
larger than it ((cd)). **Two legs are not clean:** a Wi-Fi drop lands safely but is labelled
`failed` instead of `connection_lost` (interface fact 2 is incomplete — a drop has two shapes), and
(f)'s unencrypted half is **declared unrunnable** on this hardware with a stated reason. Seven
findings are filed with diagnoses, none blocking. **Remaining before the code freeze: nothing
session-buildable** — the open items are post-freeze work. History below.

**qn.1 is BUILT — the app frame stands.** `make gates` (go + vault +
ui), `make gates-ui-e2e` (Playwright stories 1–2), and `make image` are green inside
`quince-dev`. The daemon now has typed config over `config.yml`, SQLite + migrations,
cookie auth with a first-run set-password flow, the event bus, the `/api/ws` socket, the
web-security baseline (CSRF, WS Origin, cookie flags, rate limit, audit), and a `--demo`
mode that scripts fixture devices + a job exercising every WS event; the UI ships the auth
flow, a WS bridge feeding Zustand stores, and the Dashboard / device-details / Settings
pages bound to live demo data. A post-build review of qn.0+qn.1 (see decisions log
`qn1-review`) landed the top minors (no blocker/major). **qn.2 is BUILT + CLOSED** — the
`internal/muxd` plist protocol client + the `internal/device` registry (merge N muxers →
per-transport, per-source table keyed by UDID; reset-on-reconnect reconcile clears
detached-while-away phantoms; `device.*` events), wired into non-demo `quince serve` as the
live `DeviceReader`; full `make gates` + `make image` + `make gates-ui-e2e` green. **CI
stories 1–5 done; lab gates 6–7 (plug/unplug ≤1 s, netmuxd-USB audition) DEFERRED** — the
muxer-startup gap has since been RULED (decisions log (ar)): supervision + rescan + those
lab gates all land in **`qn.2b`**. **qn.2b is now BUILT (CI)** — the `internal/muxsup` muxer
supervisor (spawns the in-container usbmuxd `-f -S <socket>` in its own process group,
restart-w/-backoff, refuse-loudly on an already-served socket, crash-loop → `/api/health`
degraded), `POST /api/devices/rescan → 202|409` reusing the muxd reconnect→Reset→replay
reconcile, the `devices.manage_muxer` config key, and a UI **Rescan** control; `make gates` +
`make image` + `make gates-ui-e2e` green, and the supervisor was smoke-tested against the
**real** usbmuxd in the built image (`/api/health` → `muxer:{managed,state:"running"}`). **qn.2b
is now DONE** — **lab gate 7 (managed USB + Rescan) PASSED on real hardware** (Operator-confirmed on
staging; it surfaced + fixed a "live `/dev/bus/usb`" deploy-config gap, (av)); gate 8 (netmuxd-USB
audition) was **re-homed to qn.7** with a named owner (not a silent defer, (aw)). **qn.3 is BUILT +
CLOSED** — `internal/deviceops` (pair/validate/info wrappers + backup-encryption management over a **pty**,
never argv/env) + registry lockdown enrichment + the four frozen device-op endpoints + the `Op` lifecycle
+ pairing-record persistence + UI pair/encryption dialogs; full `make gates`/image/e2e green (spec-approved
with the architect's three amendments + two Operator acks). **Lab gate 8 PASSED on real hardware
(2026-07-20)** — fresh container → pair (UI) → recreate-still-paired (amendment 1) → change_password +
disable→enable, secrets proven absent from argv/env/log; four findings caught + fixed + CI-validated
(incl. a real enrichment auto-pair-on-locked-device bug). **qn.5 is DONE (CI-proven; landed
`285c40b`..`3ce5bb1`)** — the version store: `internal/storage` (4 backends + auto-probe +
journaled commit + `quince-version.json` markers + startup-reconciliation kill-matrix + adopted
discovery + encryption-branched structural `Verify` + `RepairWorkingCopy` + retention + the
(bi)/(bk) **mirror ladder**) + `clonetree` + a `versions` registry (the real `VersionReader`) +
`DELETE /api/versions/{id}` + `version.*` events + reconcile-before-serve + `deploy/storage.md`;
full `make gates`/image/e2e green ((bd), (bl)). A five-round mirror investigation ((bf)→(bk))
proved block cloning works at the POOL level but EPERMs in the unprivileged userns — the mirror
ladder clones from `working/` (never `.zfs`) via a host-side hook `mirror` verb / in-container
reflink / hardlink / copy. **Lab gate 12's remaining hardware legs (host-side mirror verb,
iMazing, syncoid, 12c destructive matrix) RE-HOMED to qn.4a** ((bm) — named owner, not a silent
defer). **qn.4a is now BUILT (CI-proven)** — the `internal/backup` job engine drives `idevicebackup2`
through the state machine into qn.5 storage (per-UDID single-flight, streaming supervisor with the
`<target>/<UDID>` symlink adapter, transcript-grounded parser, activity-sampler liveness + A3
disk-low, startup job reconciliation), the `jobs` store + command surface (`POST /api/jobs`, cancel,
`job.*`), and the `quince backup` CLI; `make gates`/image/e2e green, CI stories 1–14 (incl.
wifi-torn→`connection_lost`, verify-gate→`failed`, single-flight→409). **Lab gate 15 (real
encrypted USB backup e2e + kill-matrix + the re-homed gate-12 legs) is the remaining hardware step,
owned by qn.4a** ((bp)). **qn.4b is now BUILT (CI-proven)** — transport **`auto` resolution**
(`StartBackup` resolves against current presence — prefer USB when plugged, else Wi-Fi — stores the
CONCRETE transport on the `Job`, never `"auto"`; a device on neither transport → actionable **422**,
no job minted, design §4/(bp)), the **`quince versions verify`** + **`device repair-working-copy`**
CLI escape hatches (thin `buildStorage` + `storage.VerifyVersion`/`VerifyLatest`, browseRoot-resolved,
no new backend surface), the **live demo `JobControl`** (scripts on-demand jobs + a seeded failed job
for the retry affordance; single-flight shared with the ambient loop — reversing qn.4a's 503), and
the **UI** (live "Back up now" w/ transport override, one-tap **Retry** on failed intent groups,
**Cancel** on the running job — details page + dashboard card); `make gates`/image/e2e green, e2e
**story 4** (Back up now → cancel → retry) + the qn.4a Wi-Fi-success coverage finding retired (a
`wifi-incremental-success` story). **Lab gate 11 (both-transports UI-driven backup + honest Wi-Fi
disconnect) + gate 12c (destructive hardlink-safety matrix) — the consolidated hardware day with
qn.4a's gate 15 — remain the hardware step**, owned by qn.4b. Frontier is **qn.4b** until the
hardware day; **M3 closes then.**

| qn.5 | Storage backends (zfs snapshot-native / reflink / hardlink / copy) + reconciliation | **done (CI-proven; landed `285c40b`..`3ce5bb1`)** — `internal/storage` (4 backends + auto-probe + journaled commit + `quince-version.json` markers + startup-reconciliation kill-matrix + adopted-version discovery + structural `Verify` (encryption-branched, A1) + `RepairWorkingCopy` + retention + the (bi)/(bk) **mirror ladder**: clone-from-`working/`, hook `mirror` verb → in-container reflink → hardlink-under-matrix → copy, surfaced/UNVERIFIED reporting) + `clonetree` (FICLONE/hardlink/copy) + `versions` registry + `DELETE /api/versions/{id}` + `version.*` events + reconcile-before-serve + `deploy/storage.md`; `make gates`/image/e2e green. **Proven in CI** (11 stories + reconciliation matrix + D5a anchored-filter contract) + **real-zfs commit/Verify on hardware** during the gate-12 investigation ((bf)→(bk)). **Lab gate 12's remaining hardware legs (host-side `mirror` verb, iMazing, syncoid, 12c destructive matrix) RE-HOMED to qn.4a** ((bm); named owner, legs preserved in the qn.5 spec). Ran BEFORE qn.4 (order ruled (ar)) |
| qn.4a | Backup engine + supervisor + minimal CLI (USB gate) | **built + landed (CI); gate 15 **FULLY hardware-proven** — ENGINE legs (bs) + zfs half (bw) + **iMazing-opens PASSED (cf)**** — `internal/backup` (state-machine engine + per-UDID single-flight + `idevicebackup2` streaming supervisor w/ the `<target>/<UDID>` **symlink adapter** + transcript-grounded parser + activity-sampler liveness w/ **A3** free-space watch + preflight + Seed→Verify→Commit/Discard + **startup job-row reconciliation**) + a `jobs` table/registry (real `JobReader`) + the job command surface (`POST /api/jobs` 202/409/422, `POST …/cancel`, `job.*` events) + the `quince backup` CLI (shared `buildLiveStack`); 6 lab transcripts extracted+scrubbed. `make gates`/image/e2e green; CI stories 1–14 incl. **wifi-torn→`connection_lost`** (a stall, not an error — sampler catches it), **verify-gate→`failed`**, **single-flight→409**, **startup-reconcile→`connection_lost`/rolled-forward-`succeeded`**. Coverage backup **83.2%** / store 80.8% / httpapi 72.2%. **Gate 15 split (clarified (bv)):** the ENGINE legs PASSED on real hardware (iPad, hardlink `/backups`) — CLI-USB backup both encryption variants (A1 encrypted `Verify` on real data), version rotation, interface facts 1+5, kill-matrix `backing_up`. The **zfs half is PROVEN ((bw))**: **engine→commit on the real zfs-hook backend** (encrypted, verified, version snapshot cut), host **`mirror` verb** + **`bclonesaved`** moving live (+~3 GB), **syncoid** mid-write (both `@quince-*` restore points + dirty `working/` replicated offsite) — the constrained forced-command hook key + `rbind,rslave` host→LXC→container propagation stood up on the real rpool; three deploy-doc hook bugs found+fixed (`$2`→last-arg, image-ssh-client, create-chown). Only **iMazing-opens** (Operator GUI) is unverified. **Landed on main.** |
| qn.4b | Wi-Fi first-class + transport policy + job-history UI (closes M3) | **built (CI-proven); lab gate 11/12c (hardware) pending** — transport **`auto` resolution** (prefer-USB-when-plugged, absent→**422** no job, concrete transport stored) + httpapi passes `auto` through; **`quince versions verify <id>\|--udid`** + **`device repair-working-copy <udid>`** CLI escape hatches (`storage.VerifyVersion`/`VerifyLatest`, browseRoot-resolved, no new backend surface); **live demo `JobControl`** (on-demand scripted jobs + seeded failed job for retry; single-flight; reverses qn.4a's 503); **UI** live Back up now (auto + transport override) / one-tap Retry on failed intent groups / Cancel on running job (details page + dashboard card). `make gates`/image/e2e green (e2e **story 4**: Back up now → cancel → retry). Retired the qn.4a Wi-Fi-success coverage finding (`wifi-incremental-success` story). Coverage backup **83.4%** / demo **55.3%** (was 0) / storage **78.2%** / httpapi 72.2% / cmd/quince 8.5% (CLI wiring hw-exercised). NOT a Wi-Fi demotion ((h) stands). **Lab gate 11 (both-transports UI-driven + honest Wi-Fi disconnect) + 12c (destructive hardlink matrix) = the consolidated hardware day with qn.4a gate 15**. **CLOSED (CI) 2026-07-20 ((by)):** its CI half is landed and complete; **gate 11 is RE-HOMED to `qn.4c`** (named owner — its Wi-Fi leg should run on SUPERVISED netmuxd, the shape actually deployed, not a hand-started one), **gate 12c is DEFERRED past the code freeze** (the destructive hardlink matrix gates a backend the Operator doesn't run — zfs deployment; the hardlink tier stays disabled-to-copy, surfaced), and findings (i)/(iv)/(v) **move to qn.4c**. No session work remains here. |
| qn.4c | **netmuxd supervision + usability fixes (the DAILY-DRIVER target)** | **DONE — CI-proven + LAB GATE 11 run on hardware ((ce)): 6/8 legs passed, (d) landed safely but mislabelled, (f)'s unencrypted half declared unrunnable with a reason.** Hardware: 33.3 GB full + cabled incremental committed over supervised netmuxd/usbmuxd, `auto`→USB proven, secrets clean on both transports, iMazing opened the committed `latest/` (retires qn.4a gate 15's last leg), cancel clean, verify+commit of 33 GB in 36 s, `bclonesaved` 46.5→80.1 GiB. A **gate-blocking** bug in landed qn.4a code was found AND fixed in-session ((cd)): the target stub on the cache filesystem made the device refuse any backup bigger than it. Seven findings filed. — `internal/muxsup` generalized to a daemon **`Spec`** (name/role/argv/probe-network/address) + **`Group`** (two daemons, one rescan) + the `plannedMuxers` resolution table; **netmuxd supervised** as `--host/--port --socket-path <private> --disable-usb` (every flag verified live; the private socket path is a SAFETY flag — netmuxd deletes and rebinds whatever socket it names, and its default is usbmuxd's: a silent USB blackout, reproduced then designed out, (bz)); `/api/health` **clean break** to `muxers:[{name,role,managed,state,detail,rescan}]`; rescan stays **USB-only**. Findings fixed: **(i)-A** `willEncrypt` exit-0-empty → `off` (`unknown` now means a real read failure), **(i)-B** preflight **re-reads encryption live** before refusing (cold-lockdown hard-fail gone; still-unknown refuses with the honest reason), **(v)** `last_backup` derived from the newest committed **version** (survives restarts, covers adopted, null `job_id`) + `AnnounceBackup` on commit success, **(iv)** verified **subsumed by running** (a new `DeviceCard` test proves the card already narrates verifying/committing). `make gates`/image/**e2e 6/6** green; **image smoke: both muxers `running`, `kill -9`d netmuxd respawned, usbmuxd socket intact**. Coverage muxsup **86.9%** / device 97.8% / backup 83.8% / cmd/quince 20.9%. Deploy: the **Wi-Fi mDNS constraint** is now first-class in `compose.nas.yml` (host-networking answer + honest security tradeoff + macvlan alternative), and P1b records the Wi-Fi twin of P1 ((ca)). **Lab gate 11 = the remaining hardware day.** History: inserted 2026-07-20 ((by)) to reach the Operator's "personally usable" bar before a planned code freeze. Scope: generalize the hardware-proven `internal/muxsup` to **co-supervise netmuxd** (config-gated, TCP probe vs its unix-socket one, restart-with-backoff, health surfaced — without it nothing starts netmuxd on `compose up`, so Wi-Fi dies silently after any restart: the qn.2b-for-usbmuxd reason, pulled forward from qn.7) + fix qn.4a findings **(i)** `willEncrypt`→`unknown` mis-map + the cold-lockdown race that hard-fails a legitimate encrypted backup at preflight, **(v)** the engine never writing `device.last_backup` (→ "No backups yet" on a device with real versions), **(iv)** the card lingering at "Backing up 100%" (likely subsumed by (v)). **Inherits qn.4b gate 11** — both transports UI-driven, live progress observed on a real backup, Wi-Fi over SUPERVISED netmuxd surviving a container restart, + the iMazing glance. Gate 12c stays deferred past the freeze. |
| qn.5b | **Atomic `latest` + `working/` lifecycle redesign** | **BUILT (CI-proven) 2026-07-24 ((cp)); spec approved-with-amendments ((co)).** `make gates` + `make image` green in `quince-dev` (backup 85.2% / storage 78.9% / httpapi 73.2%). **Atomic `latest`** via in-container `renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE)` (RENAME_EXCHANGE confirmed working on the CI tmpfs by the primitive test); **per-job `working/<udid>`** seeded from `latest/` via the backend's SAFE strategy (hardlink→copy, amendment A), kept dirty on FAILURE (retry resumes, proven no-re-transfer), removed on success; **commit reordered** verify→exchange→snapshot (marker-guarded resume across the non-idempotent exchange — kill-matrix green); **symlink dance DROPPED** (idevicebackup2 target = the storage `working/` parent → free-space bug 28b97de structurally impossible); **snapshot rename** `quince-<YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM>-<ULID>` (amendment B: ULID kept); **honest internal `kind`** from the seed decision (finding #9(a)); **Reset** REST + CLI (accepted contract proposal). The two-observer gate is a CI concurrent-reader proof (`latest/` never missing/torn across a commit, both models). Hook `mirror`→`seed` verb; offsite filter drops `work/**`; canon (stack D5/D5a, design §4/§5, contracts §1/§2/§6, deploy/storage.md) updated. **Lab legs PROVEN on hardware 2026-07-24 ((ct)):** G-exchange-live/G-snapshot/G-rclone on the real rpool, Reset, keep-dirty-working, resume-without-re-seed, and **both** iPad (3 GB) + iPhone (34 GB) full cycles — plus a hardware-found seed-timeout bug fixed ((cs), branch `claude/qn5b-seed-timeout-fix`). Follow-ups RULED ((cv)): missing-versions UI ((cr)(a)) + seeding phase ((cu) opt 1) → qn.6a; continuous-reconcile ((cr)(b)) → epic (cl) constraint #7; **Finding B CLOSED ((cw), reviewed+landed (cy))** — `seed_in_progress` guard, legacy-safe, shared `prepareWorkDir` across both models; Wi-Fi failures are qn.7 (not qn.5b). **qn.5b FULLY closed**; latency mechanisms for (cu) parked evidence-gated ((cx)/(cz): gate patch dominates stand-in; in-process declined). Inserted 2026-07-22 ((cg)); ran **before the B2 cron is trusted**. Fixes the stack-D5 `PROPOSED (gap)`: both swap paths do `mv latest→latest.old; mv latest.new→latest`, so `latest/` briefly **doesn't exist** — an rclone sync crossing it **deletes the remote copy**. Scope: **exchange-rename** (`renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE)`, verified live on ZFS first; hook keeps the FICLONE reflink, quince does the privilege-free exchange); **per-job `working/`** seeded as a reflink clone of `latest/` at job start (between backups the dataset holds only `latest/` — snapshots structurally clean), **keeping the dirty `working/` on FAILURE so a retry resumes**; **commit reordered** to verify→exchange→snapshot so the version IS `latest/`; **the `<target>/<UDID>` symlink dance dropped** (it caused the free-space bug 28b97de); post-failure **Retry / Reset (± Retry-clean)** UX — 2-vs-3 actions is the implementer's call, landed as a contract proposal for review (`Reset` = the landed `RepairWorkingCopy`, CLI-only today). Collapses D5's two version models toward one. **Also inherits gate-11 finding #9(a) ((cj)): honest `full`-vs-`incremental` `kind` derived from whether `working/` was seeded from an existing `latest/` — the authoritative signal, replacing the unreliable `IsFullBackup` flag — and re-confirms the server single-`is_latest` invariant holds after the commit reorder.** |
| qn.6a | **Soak-ready UI (mobile + offline devices)** | **DONE — BUILT (CI-proven) 2026-07-24 ((da)), REVIEWED + LANDED ((db), main `3a7b068`); the `seeding`-as-STATE call ratified ((db) ruling 1); two process deviations recorded as revamp evidence.** `make gates` + `make image` + `make gates-ui-e2e` green in `quince-dev` (backup 85.2% / device 97.2% / store 81.3% / demo; UI 46 vitest + 5 e2e stories, mobile leg at 390×844). Delivered: **both ruled contract changes landed** — `missing: bool` on `wire.Version` (§2) + a `seeding` state between `preflight`/`backing_up` (§2, chosen as a STATE not a bare phase — the engine models lifecycle stages as states and the card labels off `job.state`); the engine emits `seeding` around storage Seed (preflight split into checks-only + a seeding step), demo scripts it; **offline devices** (migration `0004_device_identity`, persisted identity + last-seen, `Registry.Devices()` unions live presence with `KnownUDIDs()` = distinct UDIDs with versions, offline shell has no transports + a disabled-with-reason "Back up now", and a live online→offline card transition on last-transport detach); **dead versions rendered dead** (no size/Unlock, "artifact gone — remove?" on `DELETE`, never omitted); **gate-11 findings** — #6 failed-newest "needs attention · Retry" card line, #7 client single-`is_latest` invariant in the versions store, #10-byte honest "current file" labelling, (ck) `kind` dropped from the version card; **the log-blob `SplitFunc`** (split on `\r` so progress redraws are per-frame → latest bytes, clean pane, and pure-redraw frames dropped from the log = the bloat fix); **mobile-first pass** (responsive shell: sidebar→top-bar, touch targets, no horizontal overflow, log/dialog/version-list/history reflow). Friction notes recorded (`docs/specs/qn.6a/friction-notes.md`). Original scope below. **queued after qn.5b** — inserted 2026-07-22 ((ch)) so the app is genuinely usable *before* the freeze and **soaks under real daily use on staging while the process revamp runs** (the revamp is process work; the codebase is idle, and soak time can't be backfilled). **Mobile is the precondition, not polish** — desktop-only means the daily use never happens. Scope: **responsive/touch pass over the EXISTING IA** (not an IA redesign — the desktop-shaped job-log pane, version lists, dialogs and history table are the work); **offline devices listed** (union live muxd presence with UDIDs already in the versions registry + persist the identity already fetched at enrichment; same card shape with **disabled-but-explained** "Back up now", last-seen, version count); **device labels in the backup list**; gate-11 findings #6 (**failed newest attempt gets a "needs attention · Retry" line — CORE to the soak: invisible failures make the soak worthless, (cj)**), #7 (client single-`latest` invariant), #10-byte (honest byte labelling); **from the qn.5b hardware session ((cv)):** dead versions rendered **explicitly dead** (`missing: bool` on `wire.Version`, no size/`Unlock`, "artifact gone — remove?") + a **`seeding` job phase** narrating "Preparing — cloning from your last backup…" (both contract shapes ruled); and the gate-11 **log-blob `SplitFunc`** fix if it stays small (one fix clears the mangled pane + stale byte counter + log bloat — directly on the soak path). **NOT in scope:** storage onboarding (qn.6, beside P1/P1b), the Synology/alpha prerequisites (DSM feasibility spike + **12c**, which un-defers the moment a non-zfs tester appears). Forward note: **"Wake up"** via Web Push is a post-qn.12 **spike**, not this rung. **Last rung under the current process** — its friction notes feed the revamp as evidence. |
| qn.6 | v0.1 release shape (after qn.7) | outlined |
| qn.6b | **Transport patience (LAST pre-freeze insert, (de))** | **LANDED 2026-07-24 ((df) build, (dj) review, main `3720f84`); LAB LEGS RUN 2026-07-25 ((dm)) — stories 9/10/11 validated on real hardware: candidate C (fast passcode + seed-during-gate on the zfs hook), the liveness patience (rode through a multi-minute device-side pause, no false kill), and kept-dirty-working RESUME-TO-COMPLETION all PROVEN; the bad-link `-4` (band-roam-induced TLS reset, unrescuable in-flight) is a well-scoped qn.7 item (auto-resume + `-4`→connection_lost). qn.6b lab debt CLEARED. Spec approved-with-amendments ((dg)/(dh)).** `make gates` + `make image` + `make gates-ui-e2e` green in `quince-dev` (backup 83.5% / deviceops 81.5% / storage 78.1%). **(1) Patched libimobiledevice built FROM SOURCE** at pinned `LIBIMOBILEDEVICE_REF=1.4.0` with two in-tree patches (`deploy/patches/libimobiledevice/`): `0001` raises the 30 s service receive timeouts → 15 min (#1413; `property_list_service.c`+`service.c`); `0002` adds `idevicebackup2 --gate <path>`. Only libimobiledevice is built (Alpine 3.24 ships the deps incl. the undocumented `libtatsu`); runtime `idevicebackup2 --help` lists `--gate`, the on-disk lib is `1.4.0-dirty` (the patched build wins over usbmuxd's soname-pulled apk copy), `-progs` dropped. **(2) Gate patch (candidate C):** the engine launches idevicebackup2 gated (passcode fires ~1–2 s), captures the fresh `Info.plist`, seeds `working/` in parallel (storage `Seed` split into `PrepareWork`/`SeedWork`), restores the `Info.plist` over the clone, opens the gate — proven end-to-end (`TestStoryGatedSeedOverlap`: committed version carries the FRESH `Info.plist`, passcode narrated during seeding; resume bypasses the gate). **(3) Liveness retune:** `LivenessTimeout` 15m → **18m** (= `toolReceiveTimeout` 15m + 3m margin) with a mechanical coupling guard — the sampler out-waits the tool's patience so a flap the tool rides out is never SIGKILLed, and (spike) a cleanly-idle dead link (tool loops `-5` forever) is classified only by the sampler. **Amendment A ((dg)):** the one unbounded non-backup tool op (`Manager.Validate`) bounded by `deviceOpTimeout` 30 s (interactive pair/encryption keep 2m/5m, both < 15m). **Item-4 verdict:** the captured Wi-Fi hang (`Could not receive (-4)`) was the tool's own exit (`outcomeProcErr` at ~44 s), NOT a sampler miss — a tool-patience defect item 1 targets; quince behaved correctly (kept dirty working). Contract changes: **NONE** (enum/state reused). Canon updated (stack D2, design §4 + the `seeding` state added to the state diagram, missing since qn.6a). Privacy swept clean (pcap fixtures local-only; patches infra-free). **Lab legs (were owed, now RUN — (dm)):** story 9 characterized (the `-4` boundary), stories 10/11 passed; candidate B not needed. Branch `claude/qn6b-*`, not pushed; architect lands ff-only via PR-CI. |

**Open questions for the Operator** (tracked here until resolved):
1. LAN registry port + creds (address recorded in `local/environment.md`; env-only,
   never committed).
2. ~~Who starts the muxer in the SIMPLE profile?~~ **RESOLVED 2026-07-20** — ruled
   option (a): quince-supervised in-container muxer behind `devices.manage_muxer`
   (refuse-loudly on an already-served socket) + `POST /api/devices/rescan`; landed as
   rung **qn.2b** together with qn.2's deferred lab gates. Full ruling: decisions log
   (ar); contracts §1/§6 + design §2 updated; the design capture stays in the qn.2 spec
   appendix.
3. ~~`Device.last_backup.job_id` → nullable?~~ **RESOLVED 2026-07-21 ((bz))** — approved and
   landed in contracts §2 ahead of the rung (the qn.2b precedent): `last_backup` derives from
   the newest **committed version** (survives restarts, covers adopted versions, which have no
   job → `null`), and means the last **successful** backup; a failed last attempt lives in the
   intent-grouped job history. Built by **qn.4c** (finding (v)).

*Resolved:* **project name = quince** (Operator, 2026-07-18, after due diligence — see
decisions log (y); repo `github.com/novkostya/quince`, images
`ghcr.io/novkostya/quince`, binaries `quince` / `quince-vault`, rung prefix `qn.`).
License = MIT. `@mercury-fx/ui` = not consumed; mainstream vendored-component stack
instead (decisions log (u)). GitHub owner = `github.com/novkostya` (org transfer only
on real traction).

**Decisions log.** *(Newest entries append at the bottom.)*
- 2026-07-18: full planning pass (this docs set) from the feasibility lab
  (`../local/chatgpt-original-idea-chat.md`); Go core + Python vault + React/mercury-style UI;
  USB primary / Wi-Fi experimental; ZFS first-class with hardlink portable fallback.
- 2026-07-18 (Operator review): (a) vault seam made explicitly swappable — a future
  all-Go vault is a drop-in behind `vault.Vault` + the conformance suite; (b) host
  auto-snapshot tooling rejected — quince relies only on snapshots it creates; (c) the
  never-mutate-latest layout (`versions/` + `latest` + `work/`) adopted — dataset is
  crash/replication-consistent at any instant (sanoid/syncoid-safe), rollback machinery
  deleted; (d) persistent backup-content indexing rejected in favor of lazy
  session-scoped reads; sole exception = fingerprint-validated derived caches
  (thumbnails, qn.11). Side effect of (d): no secrets at rest in v1.
- 2026-07-18 (Operator review 2): (e) photos parked at lowest priority — Operator's photo
  pipeline is icloudpd + Immich; if revived, spike Apple's prebuilt in-backup thumbnails
  (`Media/PhotoData/Thumbnails`) before any generation/cache machinery — likely moots the
  derived-cache exception entirely; (f) operations UX fixed as a core value (stack D12):
  Plex-grade setup (compose up → onboard in UI, everything configurable in-app) with
  OpenWrt/PVE-grade config — one tidy hand-editable `config.yml` as source of truth,
  atomic validated writes, no secrets in it, UI is an editor over the file.
- 2026-07-18 (external crosscheck review, `../local/chatgpt-planning-crosscheck-feedback.md`,
  adjudicated with the Operator): **Operator rulings** — (g) zfs backend is
  snapshot-native (in-place `current/`, versions = quince's own snapshots, no hardlinks
  under ZFS; consistency guarantee restated per-backend: on zfs it lives in the
  snapshots, the head is a working buffer); (h) Wi-Fi is the PRIMARY use case —
  first-class transport from qn.4, hardening rung (qn.7) moved BEFORE v0.1, experimental
  flag removed (rejects the crosscheck's Wi-Fi demotion). **Crosscheck adopted** —
  journaled commit + first-class startup reconciliation with on-disk
  `quince-version.json` markers; two-level verification (structural at commit, content
  canary at next unlock); vault RPC hardening (framed `initialize`, `materialize` with
  opaque handles — no paths cross the boundary, scratch-jailed vault); web security
  baseline pulled into qn.1 + audit trail + tmpfs scratch honesty; hardened deployment
  profile (muxd split) as a qn.6 compose example; domain APIs envelope-frozen only,
  fields after research spikes; D12 config staged (core in qn.1, live-reload/comments in
  qn.6); headless CLI added to qn.4; destructive hardlink-safety matrix replaces the
  single-file inode check. **Crosscheck rejected** — per-version/clone ZFS datasets
  (don't propagate into container bind mounts; fragile hook chains), CLI-first roadmap
  restructure (parallel tracks already decouple UI; CLI lands inside qn.4), Wi-Fi
  demotion (see h).
- 2026-07-18 (Operator clarification, second pass): the offsite model is **whole-tree
  file-level sync** — one rclone job over the entire storage parent (e.g.
  `/rpool/userdata`), walking live mounts; per-dataset `.zfs` paths don't fit it. Design
  restated as D5a: each zfs device dataset holds `current/` (in-place working copy,
  excluded by one static rclone filter) + `latest/` (verified mirror rebuilt at commit —
  reflink clone preferred, probed fallbacks hardlink/copy — atomic swap); flow =
  `zfs snapshot -r && rclone sync /rpool/userdata b2:…`, remote history via B2
  versioning/`--backup-dir`. **Operator ruling: one child dataset per device**
  (independent snapshot streams; snapshot list = version list), so the constrained hook
  gains `zfs create` scoped to children of the parent; dataset destroy stays
  human-only. PVE bind-mount propagation gotcha (new child = empty stub in a running
  LXC) handled by probe + printed `pct set` instructions; Docker via `:rshared`;
  single-dataset fallback mode documented.
- 2026-07-18 (Operator Q&A, third pass): (k) PVE propagation — recommended mount is a
  raw `lxc.mount.entry … rbind,rslave` (+ `propagation: rslave` on the nested OCI bind),
  making new child datasets appear live without restart; probe verifies, `pct set`
  instructions remain the fallback; (l) FICLONE works through container bind mounts
  (syscall reaches the real fs) — cloning implemented in-process in Go, so busybox `cp`
  is irrelevant; host OpenZFS must have block cloning (2.2+, probed); (m) **`reflink`
  promoted to a first-class backend and the auto-default** wherever the FICLONE probe
  passes (Btrfs/Synology, XFS, hookless ZFS) — `zfs` backend selected only on explicit
  config intent (`storage.zfs.*`), per the Operator's proposal; hardlink-safety matrix
  now applies only where hardlinks are actually used.
- 2026-07-18 (crosscheck v2 adjudication + Operator's passcode correction): **the
  product model is ASSISTED backup** — Operator established that modern iOS demands
  on-device passcode entry for every backup, so unattended backups are impossible;
  auto-retry ladder deleted (failed → `user action required` + one-tap manual retry
  with `retry_of`; run/attempt grouping thereby unnecessary); Shortcut becomes a dumb
  opportunity signal with ALL policy server-side (`/api/automation/backup-opportunity`,
  staleness + cooldown config); v0.1 gate rewritten to a week of real UI-driven Wi-Fi
  backups, qn.12 gate = the assisted acceptance list. Crosscheck v2 refinements
  adopted: zfs `latest/` built from the snapshot's `.zfs` path (snapshot = canonical
  version, latest = materialized view; FICLONE-from-snapshot probed with lock-guarded
  fallback); "self-heals" softened to candidate-plus-verification with
  `repair-working-copy` escape hatch; liveness = activity sampler with staged states
  (`active → silent_but_connected → suspected_stall`) + `waiting_for_passcode` pause;
  **`latest/` is a real directory on all backends, never a symlink** (namespace commit
  = journaled rotation, offsite filter excludes `versions/` too); roll-forward
  principle — post-verify artifacts are never destroyed by recovery, reconciliation
  completes commits instead of unwinding them.
- 2026-07-18 (crosscheck v3 + Operator): (p) **Intent model adopted lightweight** —
  `intent_id` (retry-chain root) + `attempt` on Job; UI groups history by intent
  ("Backup completed after 1 retry"); full server-side Intent entity parked as future
  evolution (Operator liked the concept; ChatGPT itself rated it non-essential for v1).
  (q) **`current/` renamed `working/`** (Operator ruling: names must be readable
  without context — `working`/`latest` self-explains, `current`/`latest` doesn't).
  While renaming, the offsite filter examples were fixed to **anchored** rules — an
  unanchored `**/working/**` exclude would silently drop same-named dirs inside backup
  content (corrupted offsite copy, no error); deploy docs must ship the exact anchored
  filter block.
- 2026-07-18 (Operator concern → process + first gap): (r) **the gap protocol** —
  CLAUDE.md's "everything is decided" softened to canon-so-far; the program doc now
  defines what an agent does at a gap: rung-local → decide in-spec + log (*rung-ruled*);
  architectural → `PROPOSED (gap)` block in the canon doc + open question + STOP for
  Operator ruling; silent deviation and silent doc-vs-reality "fixes" forbidden.
  (s) **first gap processed — backup-encryption management** (Operator-spotted):
  `Device.backup_encryption` from `WillEncrypt`; `POST /api/devices/{udid}/encryption`
  (enable/change_password/disable; passwords via pty or `BACKUP_PASSWORD` env, argv
  forbidden; on-device passcode step narrated); `backup.require_encryption: true`
  policy enforced actionably at preflight; unencrypted devices get a persistent warning
  (no Health/Keychain/passwords) and unencrypted versions carry `encrypted: false`
  badges; one-password-two-uses documented (device backup password == vault unlock
  password; quince sets it, never stores it). Landed in qn.3 scope.
- 2026-07-18 (Operator rulings, product/UX round): (t) **device-centric IA** — one
  primary area (`Devices` + `Settings`); home = Devices dashboard (device cards,
  `Back up now`, inline job progress, N most recent backups across devices — composed
  to look alive for small fleets); backups live inside their device's details page;
  phone-first entry point (PWA opened from a backed-up device lands on that device)
  parked for qn.12. (u) **frontend stack finalized** (revision of D7): Tailwind v4 +
  vendored shadcn-style components on Radix + Zustand + TanStack Query/Virtual; Effector
  dropped and `@mercury-fx/ui` not consumed (Operator wants maximally mainstream,
  maintainable, lightweight, LLM-fluent; mercury stays a taste reference). (v) license
  = MIT. (w) GitHub owner = Operator's personal account (org transfer only on real
  traction); handle pending — later confirmed as `novkostya`. (x) the original codename
  `compote` ruled out as the production name — naming brainstorm opened.
- 2026-07-18 (naming, final): (y) **the project is named `quince`.** Vetted: GitHub
  exact-name sweep (nothing above 31★; runner-ups sunduk/coffret/cargohold recorded in
  chat), npm/PyPI hits are dead micro-packages, Docker Hub clear, no dev-tool product
  conflict (QuinCe the oceanography QC tool is a distinct stylization in a distant
  field; the Quince fashion brand is retail-class — negligible confusion for a free
  self-hosted tool; re-check trademarks properly before any commercialization). All
  docs, rung IDs (`cp.` → `qn.`), env prefixes (`QUINCE_`), snapshot names
  (`@quince-*`), and marker files renamed from the `compote` codename this day.
- 2026-07-18 (post-rename completeness audit, Operator-requested): (z) full doc sweep
  against the conversation's decision history. Fixed: a stale D3 paragraph still
  describing the deleted auto-retry backoff ladder (contradicted D13; replaced with
  assisted-model wording); `reflink` missing from the `Version.backend` enum and two
  "hardlink/copy"-only phrasings; a leftover pre-reflink auto-probe sentence in design
  §5; qn.1 roadmap wrongly including file-watch (staged to qn.6 per D12); lab
  deployment note updated to the `rbind,rslave` recommendation; `dirty-current` →
  `dirty-working` leftovers; stale module-path rename note in qn.0. Gap closed: pair/
  encryption ops returned `op_id` with no way to observe them — added `Op` object,
  `GET /api/ops/{op_id}`, and `op.updated` WS event (the "tap Trust"/"enter passcode"
  narration channel). All other rulings verified present and correctly stated.
- 2026-07-19: (aa) repo root = `~/iphone-backup-app` as-is (git init in place, qn.0);
  the `chatgpt-*.md` planning transcripts and the generated `quince-planning-pack.md`
  stay on disk but are **gitignored** — private lab material never enters the public
  repo; committed transcript fixtures are the durable extract.
- 2026-07-19: (ab) device scope widened in wording (Operator): iPhone AND iPad are
  first-class (same pairing/MobileBackup2 protocol, no extra code); Vision Pro
  untested/unpromised (visionOS may be iCloud-only); Apple Watch out of scope (no
  backup protocol). No iPhone-string-specific code allowed.
- 2026-07-19: (ac) **dev environment ruled** (Operator, after the first qn.0 session
  correctly stopped at the undocumented gap): the driving workstation is a thin client —
  no toolchains or container runtime on it, ever; all gates/builds/pushes run in a
  dedicated `quince-dev` LXC on the Operator's local PVE host (same LAN as the
  test iPhone and the LAN registry); the remote big-iron host is NOT in the dev loop —
  heavy repeatable CI is GitHub Actions. Concrete hosts/addresses/sizing live in
  `local/environment.md` (gitignored Operator-local layer, created this day). Program
  doc gained "Where work runs"; qn.0 gained story 0.
- 2026-07-19: (ad) **public/private doc split** (Operator-spotted: the dev-env edit was
  about to push homelab internals to the public repo): `local/` (gitignored) now holds
  all Operator-specific facts — hosts, LAN addresses, container sizing, lab details;
  public canon states rules generically and references `local/environment.md` by path
  only. Personal identifiers scrubbed from public docs (example device names, private
  design-system paths). Standing rule: hostnames, IPs, topology, and hardware specifics
  never enter committed files.
- 2026-07-19: (ae) **dev box is Alpine + nerdctl via the house template flow** (Operator
  overruling the architect's Debian suggestion; the glibc-for-Playwright concern is
  solved the Alpine way — containerized Playwright runner, or system chromium; qn.1
  verifies and records). Template built by the Operator's template-factory script with
  buildkit enabled (the existing template lacks it); the clone is **resized up front**
  (cores/RAM/swap/rootfs) because template defaults will OOM/ENOSPC on builds — never
  wait for the OOM to size a build box. `TMPDIR` moved off the small tmpfs `/tmp`.
  Multi-arch images stay in GitHub Actions; local builds are amd64-only. Full sequence
  with exact commands: `local/environment.md`.
- 2026-07-19: (af) **the dev host is a container host, not a toolchain host** (Operator
  ruling, superseding the apk-toolchain part of (ae)): no language toolchains install
  on any host, ever — every gate target runs inside a pinned toolchain container
  (nerdctl/docker autodetect in the Makefile), using the same base images as the
  production Dockerfile stages; `versions.env` pins image references in exactly one
  place; named cache volumes keep it fast; Playwright runs in its official image
  (musl question mooted); CI runs the identical containerized `make gates`.
  Contributor requirement collapses to `make` + a container runtime.
- 2026-07-19: (ag) **the qn.0 usbmuxd `PROPOSED` gap is dissolved, not chosen between**:
  the architect verified live that `usbmuxd` IS packaged in Alpine community on every
  branch v3.21–v3.24 — the session's probe was faulty. Runtime ships it via `apk add`;
  profiles unchanged (simple = in-container daemon + USB mapping, hardened = host
  socket). Operator's netmuxd-only question ruled alongside: netmuxd alone fully serves
  **pre-paired, Wi-Fi-sync-enabled** devices, so netmuxd-first sequencing inside
  qn.2/qn.3 is encouraged — but initial pairing and enabling Wi-Fi sync are USB-only at
  the protocol level, so USB stays in scope with hardware validation in the lab CT, and
  fresh-device USB pairing must work by the qn.6 gate. Lesson added to D2: verify
  package existence with `apk search` against the target repo, never assume.
- 2026-07-19: (ah) **netmuxd is the single muxer for BOTH transports** (Operator-
  identified, README-verified, superseding the two-daemon halves of (ag) and D2's
  original wording): netmuxd v0.4+ handles USB natively via `nusb` — "no dependency on
  a separate usbmuxd daemon"; the project outgrew its network-only name. Core's muxd
  client targets N configured sockets with N=1 default; classic usbmuxd stays in the
  image as a config-only fallback because netmuxd's USB path is young (v0.4.3 released
  2026-07-14) vs usbmuxd's decades — lab gates in qn.2 (presence + fresh USB pairing)
  and qn.4/qn.5 (sustained USB backup) decide whether the fallback is ever needed.
  Protocol floor unchanged: fresh-device adoption requires a USB connection regardless
  of which daemon serves it.
- 2026-07-19: (ai) **Operator recalled hard evidence against netmuxd-USB** — an initial
  USB backup through netmuxd died with a "packet too big"-style error at the 64 MiB
  boundary + 1 byte (hardcoded-guard signature; unreported in netmuxd's tracker as of
  today; observed version unknown). Ruling amended: **default USB topology = usbmuxd,
  netmuxd serves Wi-Fi** until qn.2's netmuxd-USB audition (presence + fresh pairing +
  a >64 MiB transfer on pinned v0.4.3) passes clean, whereupon the default flips to
  single-muxer; a reproduction gets filed upstream with the signature, with a
  patched-pinned-build option (the qn.7 libimobiledevice pattern). N-socket client
  design makes the flip config-only either way.
- 2026-07-19: (aj) **the (ai) signature corrected against the lab log** (Operator found
  the exact line, dated 2026-07-13): it's the **64 KiB u16 boundary**, not 64 MiB —
  `netmuxd::usb::mux … asyncReadComplete, message was too large (65536 bytes,
  max = 65535)` — i.e. netmuxd HAD USB support during the lab and its mux read path
  choked one byte over `0xFFFF` on real backup traffic; plausibly a one-line fix.
  v0.4.3 shipped the NEXT DAY noting "Fixes iTunes on the Apple mux" — possibly this
  bug, unconfirmed; the qn.2 audition (real backup traffic on pinned v0.4.3) decides.
  Exact line quoted in stack D2; default topology ruling from (ai) unchanged.
- 2026-07-19: (ak) **RETRACTION of the "faulty probe" accusation in (ag)/(ah)**: the
  authoritative per-branch APKINDEX check shows `usbmuxd` in **Alpine 3.24 community
  ONLY** (absent 3.21–3.23) — the qn.0 session's original finding was CORRECT for its
  3.21 base; the architect's all-branches "verification" was the flawed one (apk's
  `--repository` appends to configured repos; all four queries were answered by the dev
  box's own 3.24 repo). The build session's `ALPINE_VERSION=3.21 → 3.24` bump is
  ratified — additionally right because 3.21 (Nov 2024) nears EOL while 3.24 is current
  stable and matches the dev/lab CT line. Follow-up (non-blocking): align toolchain
  images to 3.24-based tags where published. Lesson upgraded in D2: verify package
  claims against the branch APKINDEX or a clean container of that branch.
- 2026-07-19: (al) **new hard rule: "version pins are looked up, never remembered"**
  (Operator-proposed after tracing the 3.21 pin to LLM training-data staleness — a
  model's "current" is its training cutoff's current; third staleness incident today
  incl. two of the architect's). Every pin introduction/bump queries the live source at
  pin time, prefers the newest stable with support runway, and comments any deviation
  from newest with its reason. Landed in the program doc's hard rules.
- 2026-07-19: (am) **the private layer is now version-controlled** (Operator concern:
  gitignored = untracked, unbacked-up, unsynced — quince-dev had no `local/` at all):
  `local/` is a nested git repo pushed to a **private GitHub repo only** (Operator
  choice over self-hosted bare / hybrid), privacy verified; the four `chatgpt-*.md`
  lab/review logs MOVED into it (public doc references updated to `local/chatgpt-*`);
  clone landed on quince-dev (sync gap closed) with a deploy key awaiting the
  Operator's read-only registration; convention added to the program doc — sessions
  editing `local/**` commit in the nested repo. Root `/chatgpt-*.md` gitignore patterns
  retained as belt-and-braces.
- 2026-07-19: (an) **privacy incident + new hard rule**: early qn.0 commits carried LAN
  IPs/hostnames in docs and commit messages; the Operator had the implementer rewrite
  history to scrub them (history verified clean post-rewrite). Cemented in the program
  doc: privacy is a **commit-time gate** — private facts never enter committed files,
  commit messages, branch names, or fixtures; `make privacy-check` (new target) greps
  every staged diff against `local/privacy-patterns.txt` (private repo; no-ops for
  contributors/CI); leak-reaches-history = incident = rewrite + pattern added.
- 2026-07-19: (ao) **Go rewrite of the decryption library greenlit as a parallel
  independent project** (Operator-proposed; scope verified small+frozen — reference lib
  last released 2024, format stable since iOS 10.2, all primitives have mature Go
  counterparts). Repo `github.com/novkostya/ios-backup-crypt` (name vetted 2026-07-19 — 0 GitHub
  collisions, module path + pkg.go.dev free; public MIT; seed CLAUDE.md/README/LICENSE
  authored, awaiting kickoff); includes a test-only encrypt/builder that
  doubles as qn.8's synthetic-fixture generator. **Subprocess boundary kept** (Operator
  ruling): quince-vault becomes a thin Go binary on the unchanged stdio RPC; key
  isolation preserved. qn.8's vault implementation is now conditional — Go if the
  library passes the conformance + real-backup differential gates by rung start,
  Python otherwise. Zero coupling: quince contracts and schedule unaffected either way.
- 2026-07-19: (ap) **improvement-proposal channel added** (Operator-proposed, designed
  with the architect): a non-blocking sibling of the gap protocol — implementers may
  file at most ONE proposal per rung, at rung end only, never pre-implemented, meeting
  a material-value bar (correctness/reliability/security/UX/maintenance; anti-bikeshed
  clause), into `docs/quince.proposals.md`; Operator triages accepted/declined(+why)/
  parked, and decline reasons accumulate as readable taste. Rationale: implementers
  have repeatedly out-seen the canon (Alpine 3.24, Tailwind pin, Makefile design) but
  had no legitimate outlet; the cap + timing + no-prototype rules keep the
  no-improvising discipline intact. quince-only (Operator: ios-backup-crypt is
  near-complete — no value installing process there).
- 2026-07-19: (ag) **qn.0 BUILT — the floor stands.** Provisioned `quince-dev`
  on the PVE host per the `local/environment.md` sequence verbatim (Alpine+nerdctl+buildkit
  template → clone → sized → `<lan-ip>`); recorded the exact `pct` commands back into that
  file. Scaffolded `core/` (Go: `serve`+`version`, `/api/health`, `go:embed` UI, slog,
  race-tested), `vault/` (uv `quince-vault` with `selftest` importing
  `iphone_backup_decrypt`), `ui/` (Vite+React+TS+Tailwind v4 sidebar shell, vitest), the
  containerized `Makefile`, multi-stage `deploy/Dockerfile` (netmuxd built from source),
  CI, compose examples, `deploy/dev.md`, transcript-README. **Proven in-container:** full
  `make gates` green, `make image` green, and the image's runtime gates
  (`version`/`health`/`selftest`/embedded-UI) all pass. Rung-ruled bootstrapping fixes
  (in the qn.0 spec + `versions.env`): uv image `-alpine` tag, Tailwind `4.1.18` (4.0.0
  crashes), Rust `1.88` (netmuxd needs edition 2024), pnpm `overrides.vite`, mypy
  stub-override, vault venv built at its final path against the runtime python.
  **`.gitignore` bug caught by testing**: trailing inline comments silently disabled the
  private-file rules — rewritten with column-0 comments; private lab logs now verified
  `!!` ignored. **Registry push proven**: `make push REGISTRY=<lan-registry>` pushed
  `quince:local` to the LAN registry (endpoint in `local/environment.md`) and it pulls
  back. Per (ak)'s follow-up the toolchain images were then migrated to a single
  Alpine-3.24 line (Go 1.26.5 / Node 22.23.1 / Rust 1.97.1 / golangci-lint v2), re-proven
  green; the `usbmuxd` daemon (Alpine 3.24 community) now ships in the runtime — so the
  old D2 `PROPOSED` gap is closed, not open. Before any push, one privacy incident
  (Operator infra in commit messages + an earlier version of this entry) was scrubbed by a
  full `git` history rewrite — the origin of the "Privacy is a commit-time gate" hard
  rule. Next frontier: **qn.1** (spec to be written).
- 2026-07-19: (ah-qn1) **qn.1 BUILT — the app frame stands.** Full `make gates`
  (go + vault + ui), `make gates-ui-e2e` (Playwright stories 1–2), and `make image` green
  in `quince-dev`. **Core** (`core/internal/{wire,config,store,auth,bus,ws,demo}` +
  expanded `httpapi` + `id`): typed schema-v0 config with atomic canonical writes /
  last-good-on-invalid / `quince config validate`; modernc SQLite (WAL) with embedded
  migrations (`settings`/`sessions_auth`/`audit`); argon2id auth with first-run
  set-password (one-shot **409** guard), session rotation, idle/absolute timeouts, per-IP
  login rate limit, and double-submit CSRF; a race-clean event bus (drop-on-slow) + the
  `/api/ws` handler (pre-upgrade auth + strict Origin, `hello` frame, ping keepalive); the
  full REST read surface (devices/jobs/versions/config) golden-tested against contracts §2;
  a security middleware chain (recover, CSP + frame denial, body limit, auth guard, CSRF
  guard); and a `--demo` provider scripting device churn + a backup with a
  silent-stall→recovery arc + every WS event type. **UI**: react-router auth-gated shell,
  a WS bridge feeding Zustand stores with reconnect-backoff + GET-refresh, vendored
  shadcn-style components on Radix, Dashboard / device-details / Settings pages on live
  demo data, and a shared humanizer. **Operator rulings this rung** (also in the spec's
  rung-ruled section + contracts §1): the auth endpoints (`/api/auth/status`, `/api/auth/setup`
  with the 409 guard, double-submit CSRF) and adopting `react-router-dom`. Rung-local calls:
  library set looked up live (yaml.v3 / modernc / coder-websocket / x/crypto / oklog-ulid;
  zustand / TanStack Query / Radix), embedded-SQL migration runner, Secure-cookie-off in
  demo (so http e2e/localhost login works), hardcoded admin-session timeouts (future
  `auth:` config noted for qn.6), slog JSON/TTY, config exchanged as structured JSON,
  golden fixtures via `make gen-golden`, and a two-container Playwright e2e target
  (`gates-ui-e2e`, CI `e2e` job) using the official Playwright image. Not yet committed
  (awaiting Operator). Next frontier: **qn.2**.
- 2026-07-19: (aq) **domain parsing goes to a standalone sibling library —
  `ios-backup-parser` — and the repo-naming policy is ruled.** Naming (Operator, after
  discussion): `quince-*` prefixes only app satellites (the private local layer today;
  helm/docs/demo someday); standalone libraries carry descriptive names — the
  `ios-backup-*` family (`-crypt`, now `-parser`). Rationale: the brand lives in the
  owner segment (a future org would follow the `immich-app` pattern — the bare `quince`
  account is taken), descriptive names win search discoverability, and Go module paths
  make renames expensive. Name picked from a vetted-unique shortlist
  (parser/records/content/data; `-artifacts` rejected on taste). The library: pure-Go,
  MIT, typed *streaming* records for messages/contacts/call-history/calendar/notes
  from already-decrypted backups; zero coupling to quince OR ios-backup-crypt (host
  supplies a `BackupFS` accessor); schema detection by introspection + per-backup
  capability reports (state honesty ported); license-hygiene rule — iLEAPP (MIT) is
  translatable with attribution and a differential oracle, imessage-exporter (GPL-3)
  is a black-box oracle ONLY (its typedstream/`attributedBody` ground is the known
  hard part); milestones: schema spike → contacts → calls → messages → calendar →
  notes → v0.1. Ecosystem verified live this day: no reusable Go artifact-parsing
  library exists. Quince side: qn.10's research spike is subsumed by the library's M0
  (off the critical path); qn.9/qn.10 consume the library iff the Go vault (D4/(ao)
  chain) landed at qn.8 AND the domain is covered — else in-vault adapters as specced.
  Roadmap M7 + design §7 updated; §7's adapter keying refined from "iOS major version"
  to "detected schema" (introspection, never a trusted version string). Photos remain
  parked. Charter seeded at the sibling repo (CLAUDE.md/README/LICENSE); separate
  implementer to be spun up by the Operator.
- 2026-07-19: (qn1-review) **qn.0/qn.1 post-build review + fixes.** A read-only conformance
  review (specs + frozen contracts §1–§6 + design §6) found **no blocker/major** — both rungs
  conform and the security baseline is sound — plus a tail of minors. Top items fixed this
  pass (full `make gates` + `make image` + `make gates-ui-e2e` re-green): (1) `GET
  /api/jobs/{id}/log` (frozen in contracts §1) was unrouted — now served `text/plain` via
  `JobReader.JobLog`, demo-backed by a per-job log ring buffer, and the UI recovers a running
  job's log tail on WS reconnect (the `job.log` stream isn't replayable — closes the story-2
  hole); (2) the demo now emits `device.updated` on backup success (refreshing `last_backup`),
  so every §3 WS event type fires end to end and the device card no longer goes stale; (3) a
  demo fixture set `last_backup.job_id` to a version id, not the job id (golden regenerated);
  (4) auth hardening — `verifyPassword` now rejects an empty-key hash (was fail-open via
  `ConstantTimeCompare` of two empty slices) and the login rate-limiter sweeps stale per-IP
  buckets so the map can't grow unbounded; tests cover all three. **Deferred (logged, not
  blocking):** WS session re-validation on logout/idle-expiry, DSN-scoped SQLite pragmas, a
  `.dockerignore`, and assorted nits. Frontier unchanged: **qn.2**.
- 2026-07-19: (qn2-build) **qn.2 code built.** The `internal/muxd` plist protocol client
  (`howett.net/plist v1.0.1`, Listen handshake, per-connection DeviceID→UDID map, reconnecting
  dialer) and the `internal/device` **registry** (N-muxer merge, per-transport/per-source
  presence keyed by UDID, **reset-on-(re)connect reconcile** clearing detached-while-away
  phantoms, `device.*` events), wired into non-demo `quince serve` as the live `DeviceReader`
  (default topology usbmuxd-USB + netmuxd-Wi-Fi; single-muxer flip is config-only). CI stories
  1–5 green under full `make gates`; lab gates 6–7 (plug/unplug ≤1 s + the netmuxd-USB
  audition) remain a hardware step. `muxd.Client.Run` now takes a `Sink{Reset,Apply}`;
  rung-ruled details in `specs/qn.2/qn.2.md`. The no-flicker snapshot-debounce reconcile
  (idle-debounce + `testing/synctest`) is the documented refinement if reconnect churn bites.
- 2026-07-20: (qn2-close) **qn.2 closed; muxer-startup gap surfaced + documented.** qn.2's
  deliverables (muxd client + `internal/device` registry + UI; `make gates`/image/e2e green) are
  complete; a post-build review + UI polish (empty-state copy, state-driven device card — disabled
  `Pair`/`Back up now` reflecting muxd-minimal presence) landed alongside. Its **lab gates 6–7 are
  deferred** to a future hardware session (they need a real device AND the muxer-startup gap
  resolved). During staging testing an architectural gap was surfaced — **nothing starts the
  in-container muxer, breaking D12 for USB** — and captured as **open question 2** (`PROPOSED
  (gap)`, for the Architect; not decided/built here). A staging stand was stood up on the PVE host
  (CT 113, `quince:staging` from the private registry, HTTPS via the CT-102 Caddy) for manual
  testing; its USB path uses a **temporary usbmuxd-in-CT + socket-bind workaround** (hotplug needs
  the `/root/redetect.sh` helper), rebuilt onto the house template's `/root/compose.yml` autostart
  convention (specifics in `local/environment.md`). Frontier → **qn.3**.
- 2026-07-20: (ar) **qn.2 cleanup package: muxer gap ruled, qn.2b inserted, qn.5↔qn.4
  swapped, worktree-init fixed** (Architect adjudication + Operator rulings). (1) Open
  question 2 RULED as option (a): quince supervises the in-container muxer — Go subprocess
  in its own process group under the serve context, restart-on-crash with capped backoff,
  killed on shutdown, **refuse-loudly if the socket is already served** (no silent
  adoption) — behind `devices.manage_muxer` (true = simple profile; false =
  hardened/external, making the staging socket-bind topology a supported mode), plus
  `POST /api/devices/rescan → 202|409` + UI Rescan reusing the reset/replay reconcile.
  Contracts §1/§6 and design §2 updated (the architect landed the contract-change ahead of
  the rung, per program rule). (2) **New rung `qn.2b`** (M1, before qn.3): MINIMAL
  supervision scope + rescan + **ownership of qn.2's deferred lab gates 6–7** (plug/unplug
  ≤1 s + the netmuxd-USB audition) — one physical-presence session; FULL muxer work stays
  qn.6/qn.7. Deferred-without-owner is how gates evaporate; qn.3's "fresh container via UI
  only" gate also depends on this. (3) **New hard rule: "a rung's goal is provable at rung
  close"** (program doc) — the Operator-requested self-containment audit of qn.3–qn.12
  found exactly one more violation: qn.4's `succeeded` needs qn.5's `Commit()` → **order
  swapped, qn.5 before qn.4** (qn.5 proven on fixture trees + a manually-produced
  `idevicebackup2` tree; qn.4 closes M3 with the true e2e gate); rung numbers stay
  (labels, not order — qn.7-before-qn.6 precedent). (4) **Worktree init**: worktrees
  materialize only tracked files, so sessions there lacked the private `local/` layer —
  mandatory first step now documented: `ln -s ../../../local local` (symlink sits on the
  gitignored path, uncommittable; privacy-check + environment.md pointers work unchanged).
  Also noted: qn.2's out-of-scope moment was handled correctly by the gap protocol (code
  scope held; design captured as PROPOSED, not built) — the process worked. Frontier →
  **qn.2b** (spec to be written by its session from the roadmap outline + the qn.2 spec
  appendix).
- 2026-07-20: (as) **plan-time discipline made structural** (Operator correction to the
  (ar) framing: qn.2's rule-adherence was largely Operator-ENFORCED — the implementer's
  proposed plan drifted from canon until manually pointed at the rules it was about to
  break; supervision-as-guardrail doesn't scale). Two program-doc changes: (1) the spec
  shape gains a mandatory **Rule check** section — every hard rule / canon boundary the
  rung touches or comes near, one compliance line each, written before building (a plan
  about to break a rule can't fill it truthfully, so violations surface as text); (2) the
  build loop gains a **pre-build spec review gate** — spec incl. Rule check → Operator
  routes it through the architect → explicit go, only then code (formalizes what
  happened ad hoc for qn.2's spec, which picked up five amendments in review).
  Repositions Operator supervision from hunting unflagged violations to adjudicating
  flagged edges. Applies from qn.2b onward.
- 2026-07-20: (at) **coverage made a declared artifact; handoff review gets named
  dimensions** (Operator-driven — third vigilance→structure conversion: the qn.2b
  handoff review found untested qn.2 cases only because the Operator explicitly
  prompted for coverage). (1) Rung reports now DECLARE coverage: the `go test -cover`
  summary + an explicit **known-untested list** (one line + reason each); declared =
  accepted debt, undeclared-found-later = a finding — state honesty applied to tests.
  (2) The rung handoff review runs four named dimensions: seams / coverage (verify the
  declaration, then hunt untested branches in consumed code) / state honesty /
  contracts. Process-budget note (Architect, Operator-acked): the program's gate set is
  now considered FULL — the next process addition should displace something, not
  append. The current coverage findings route through the existing triage: tests for
  consumed code land as `qn.2 review fix:` commits; the rest becomes declared debt or
  ledger entries.
- 2026-07-20: (au) **qn.2b BUILT (CI) — the in-container muxer has a lifecycle.** Cleared the
  new pre-build spec-review gate ((as)): spec + Rule check → **architect APPROVED with four
  amendments** (all folded in). Shipped: `internal/muxsup` supervisor (`exec.Command` usbmuxd
  `-f -S <socket>` in its own process group, restart-w/-backoff 500 ms→×2→30 s, SIGTERM→grace→
  SIGKILL on shutdown, **refuse-loudly** probe on an already-served socket, **crash-loop →
  `/api/health` degraded** with the last exit reason); `POST /api/devices/rescan → 202|409`
  reusing the muxd reconnect→`Reset()`→replay reconcile (no new device-table code), incl.
  rescan-as-recovery from degraded (takeover once the socket frees); the `devices.manage_muxer`
  config key (default true, first in `DevicesConfig`); `/api/health` `muxer:{managed,state,
  detail}`; and a UI **Rescan** control (202 in-progress / 409-explains, never a dead button).
  Wiring: managed → supervisor; external/`--demo` → `UnmanagedMuxer` (409). `make gates` +
  `make image` + `make gates-ui-e2e` green; **supervisor additionally smoke-tested against the
  REAL usbmuxd in the built image** — `/api/health` → `muxer:{managed:true,state:"running"}`,
  `usbmuxd v1.1.1_git20250201 starting up`. **Amendment 1 (verify interface facts, not just
  versions) paid off:** `usbmuxd --help` showed the daemon owns `-S/--socket` — so
  `devices.usbmuxd_socket` is authoritative via the daemon's flag, NOT the client-side
  `USBMUXD_SOCKET_ADDRESS` env the draft guessed. **Handoff review of qn.2** (four dimensions,
  (at)): gates green; `internal/device` 97.2%, but `internal/muxd` was **44%** — the entire
  `Client.Run` reconnect/backoff/dial loop and the `readPlist`/`listen` guards were untested,
  exactly the seam qn.2b's rescan consumes. Landed as a `qn.2 review fix` (`muxd/client_test.go`,
  real-socket reconnect-reconcile over unix+tcp + codec-guard cases) → muxd **85.7%**. **Coverage
  declaration ((at)):** `muxsup` 82.7%, `httpapi` 70.6%; known-untested = the SIGTERM-grace→SIGKILL
  escalation branch, the 30 s backoff-cap arithmetic, and the dial-timeout / ctx-cancel-mid-dial
  paths (timing plumbing, low-risk). **Lab gates 7–8 (plug/unplug ≤ 1 s, netmuxd-USB audition)
  remain the hardware session**, owned by this rung. `.gitignore` `local`-symlink hole surfaced
  via the qn.2b Rule check and landed on `main` (`a057783`) — rebased in. Frontier → **qn.3**
  (inherits "enrich muxd devices with lockdown identity").
- 2026-07-20: (av) **qn.2b lab finding — managed-muxer USB needs a LIVE `/dev/bus/usb`, not
  `devices:`** (surfaced testing Rescan on staging with a real iPhone; "Rescan didn't work"). Not a
  code defect — the supervisor + rescan behaved correctly. A static `devices:` mapping (runc
  `--device`) SNAPSHOTS the device-node list at container start, so a device plugged/re-enumerated
  later never appears in the container; usbmuxd restarted by Rescan then hits
  `LIBUSB_ERROR_NO_DEVICE` (`/sys` live, `/dev` node missing) — restarting the muxer can't surface
  it. Fix (deploy-only): bind `/dev/bus/usb` as a **volume** (live) + grant char-device access
  (`device_cgroup_rules: ['c 189:* rmw']` on Docker; `privileged: true` on nerdctl/podman/unpriv-LXC
  which lack device-cgroup-rules). Validated in a throwaway then deployed to staging — the
  in-container usbmuxd connected to the iPhone. `deploy/compose.nas.yml` corrected; captured in the
  qn.2b spec's Lab finding. The lab gate did its job: a real device found a deploy gap CI fakes
  can't. Rescan's "re-detect a missed device" value now correctly depends on a live container `/dev`.
- 2026-07-20: (aw) **qn.2b CLOSED; netmuxd-USB audition re-homed to qn.7** (Operator ruling). Lab
  gate 7 (managed in-container usbmuxd brings USB up via `compose up` + UI **Rescan** re-detects a
  re-plugged device) **PASSED on hardware** (Operator-confirmed on staging, after the (av) deploy
  fix). Lab gate 8 (the netmuxd-USB audition on v0.4.3) is **moved to qn.7** — it answers a
  netmuxd-viability question that pairs with qn.7's netmuxd co-supervision, qn.2b's goal doesn't
  depend on it (default topology stays usbmuxd-for-USB; the single-muxer flip is config-only either
  way), and it's the risky one (`idevicepair unpair` destroys the pairing record). **Re-assignment
  with a named owner, NOT a silent defer** — the audition procedure is preserved verbatim in the
  qn.2b spec (gate 8) for the qn.7 session to inherit, and the qn.7 roadmap row now lists it, so the
  no-orphan-gate rule qn.2b was created to enforce stays intact. qn.2b's goal (managed usbmuxd
  supervision + rescan) is proven end-to-end (CI + hardware); the rung closes. Frontier → **qn.3**.
- 2026-07-20: (ax) **P1 accepted → qn.6** (first proposal through the channel; Operator ruling,
  architect-recommended): the broken-container-USB onboarding/health check joins qn.6's §9
  guided checks (ledger + roadmap M5 updated). Post-landing architect review of qn.2b: clean —
  (aw) ratified; one docs-part-of-diff slip swept (stale audition references in stack D2 +
  roadmap M1/M4, fixed on main).
- 2026-07-20: (ay) **one project, one dev host** (Operator-ruled after an incident: a sibling
  library's gates ran on the shared dev container alongside an active quince rung — cache/
  container/memory contention got messy enough to force an emergency second box mid-rung).
  Program doc updated: sibling projects never share a dev container with quince or each other;
  per-project boxes under the same pure-container-host rules; registry + provisioning in the
  Operator-local env doc; idle boxes are stopped, not deleted. Knock-on fixes: the parser's M0
  study-data bind re-pointed from quince-dev to the parser's own (to-be-provisioned) box, and
  the sibling repos' `privacy-check` pattern lookup extended (`../quince-local/…`) so the
  commit gate stays armed on boxes that have no quince checkout next door.
- 2026-07-20: (az) **qn.3 BUILT (CI) — device ops + Devices page.** Cleared the pre-build
  spec-review gate: spec + Rule check → **architect APPROVED with three amendments + two
  rulings**, all folded in (Operator acks: hardware encryption coverage = `change_password` +
  a disable→enable cycle; keep the freshly-paired container standing). **Interface facts verified
  live** in the built image (libimobiledevice 1.4.0) — the STOP-gap cleared: `idevicebackup2`
  supports interactive `-i` (pty getpass) **and** `BACKUP_PASSWORD`/`_NEW` env; per the spec's
  pty-preference qn.3 uses the **pty** (password never in argv/env/log); `idevicepair pair` is
  **error-and-retry** (not blocking) so `waiting_for_user` is a poll-until-`SUCCESS` loop;
  `USBMUXD_SOCKET_ADDRESS` = `UNIX:<path>`/`host:port`; `ideviceinfo -x` keys + `-q
  com.apple.mobile.backup -k WillEncrypt`. Shipped: **`internal/deviceops`** (argv wrappers with
  the muxsup subprocess hygiene + a `GO_WANT_HELPER_PROCESS` fake-CLI harness; the pty-driven
  encryption path via `creack/pty v1.1.24`); **`device.Enrich`** (lockdown identity overlaid on
  the muxd-minimal shell, `device.updated` on change) + a bus-driven **enrichment driver**
  (attach → `ideviceinfo`/`idevicepair validate`, per-UDID debounced, off the request path);
  the **four frozen endpoints** (`POST …/pair` 202|404|409, `…/pair/validate`, `…/encryption`
  202|422, `GET /api/ops/{id}`) behind a consumer-defined `DeviceOps` interface; the **`Op`
  lifecycle** manager (running→waiting_for_user→succeeded|failed, `op.updated`); **audit** rows
  for pair/encryption (no secret; design §6 list updated — amendment 3); **pairing-record
  persistence** (whole-dir copy of `/var/lib/lockdown` ↔ `$QUINCE_DATA/lockdown`, amendment 1 —
  survives a container recreate); non-demo wiring + a demo `DeviceOps` scripting the op flow;
  and **UI** pair + encryption dialogs (assisted narration, unencrypted-banner CTA, USB-only 409
  explained, passwords never in URL/log). **`make gates` + `make image` + `make gates-ui-e2e`
  green** (added e2e **story 3**: encryption op narrates the assisted flow to success). **Story 5
  headline gate proven** — a test asserts the password is in no argv/env/log/audit and only
  reaches the child over the pty. **Coverage declared:** deviceops **80.2%**, device **97.6%**,
  httpapi **71.8%**; **known-untested** (accepted debt, all low-risk error/edge or trivial
  helpers): the enrichment-driver subscription-overflow `refreshAll` recovery, the ctx-cancel
  process-group SIGKILL branch, the ops-map `pruneLocked` eviction (needs 200+ ops), the
  lockdown mkdir-error warn branches, and the trivial `SetLockdown`/`encStartMsg`/`encDoneMsg`
  defaults. **Lab gate 8 (fresh container → paired → encryption on real hardware) is the
  remaining physical-presence step** — owned by this rung, not deferred. Not yet committed
  (awaiting Operator).
- 2026-07-20: (ba) **qn.3 CLOSED — lab gate 8 PASSED on real hardware.** Deployed the qn.3
  build to the staging CT (managed usbmuxd, live `/dev/bus/usb`) and drove the gate with a real
  iPhone: **(1) pair** via the quince UI on a fresh container → `paired: yes`, with the record
  written to `$QUINCE_DATA/lockdown` (proves `Backup()` fired = a real pair op, not enrichment);
  **(2) persistence** (amendment 1) → `nerdctl compose down && up` → `lockdown: restored …
  count:2` → still `SUCCESS: Validated`, no re-Trust — **proven twice** (a second redeploy for
  the UI fix repeated it); **(3) encryption** → `change_password` then a full `disable → enable`
  cycle, all succeeding, ending encryption **ON** with an Operator-held password; **(4) secrets
  (story 5) on hardware** → the capture caught `idevicebackup2 -i -u <udid> {changepw,encryption
  off,encryption on}` — **no password in argv**, `BACKUP_PASSWORD` env count **0**, clean logs —
  the password reached the child only over the pty. **Four findings caught by the gate, all fixed
  + CI-validated + committed as `qn.3 lab finding:`** — the substantive one: **enrichment
  auto-paired a locked device** (`idevicepair validate` returns "passcode is set" for ANY locked
  device regardless of pairing — observed on a fresh host with no record — so mapping it to
  `paired: yes` + then doing the auto-pairing full `ideviceinfo` could silently trigger Trust;
  fixed → locked ⇒ `paired: "unknown"`, and the full/auto-pairing read runs only for a confirmed
  `validatePaired`, everything else uses the no-auto-pair simple read); plus three UI fixes (the
  dashboard card's stale disabled Pair now routes to the details flow; the encryption mode
  switcher reset after a completed op; a persistent "confirm on the device with its passcode"
  hint; mode frozen at open + dialog auto-closes on success so the title no longer mismatches the
  result). The lab gate did its job — a real device found a real code bug the CI fakes could not.
  The paired staging container is **kept standing** as the qn.4/qn.5 base (Operator ack).
  Frontier → **qn.5** (storage; qn.5-before-qn.4 per (ar)).
- 2026-07-20: (bb) **qn.3 post-landing architect review: clean; docs-drift swept.** All three
  amendments + both rulings verified in the landed code (pty-only secret path spot-checked;
  coverage declared with an honest debt list; lab findings committed as labeled fixes). Sweep
  (same class as qn.2b's): contracts §1 now records the implemented error codes
  (pair 404/409-USB-only, encryption 422) and the RESOLVED password channel (pty `-i` verified,
  env fallback deliberately unused — the stale "qn.3 verifies which" comment closed); design §3
  gains the locked-device rule (`paired: unknown` on locked; full lockdown read only after a
  confirmed validate — the accidental-auto-pair guard, since qn.4's preflight consults the same
  path). qn.3 worktree + branch removed post-landing.
- 2026-07-20: (bc) **canon fix found by the qn.5 spec review: structural verification branches
  on encryption.** Design §4's checklist ("`Manifest.db` opens read-only + record sample
  resolves") is impossible passwordless on ENCRYPTED backups — the product default — because
  since iOS 10.2 the manifest itself is encrypted; CI fixtures (unencrypted) would have passed
  while gate 11's real encrypted tree failed. Ruled: `Manifest.plist.IsEncrypted` selects the
  variant — encrypted: exists + non-trivial size + NOT-plaintext-SQLite-magic + blob-shard
  sanity, with record-sampling deferred to the content level (qn.8's unlock, which now owns it
  for encrypted versions); unencrypted: the full checklist. Design §4 amended; qn.5's spec
  folds the branch + an encrypted fixture variant (amendment A1).
- 2026-07-20: (bd) **qn.5 BUILT (CI) — the version store stands.** Cleared the pre-build
  spec-review gate: spec + Rule check → **architect APPROVED with three amendments (A1 encrypted
  `Verify` branch, A2 a `RepairWorkingCopy` story, A3 name `Prune`'s trigger) + five rulings**, all
  folded in. Shipped: **`internal/storage`** — the `Backend` interface with two genuinely
  different models (`zfs` snapshot-native via a validated exec/hook `zfsCLI`, dataset-destroy never
  issued; `reflink`/`hardlink`/`copy` namespace-versioned), the **auto-selection probe** (FICLONE
  independence / `link()`+inode on the real `/backups`; `copy` degraded mode surfaced), **journaled
  commit** with on-disk `quince-version.json` markers + an explicit per-device commit journal,
  **first-class startup reconciliation** (roll-forward matrix: kill at every phase → defined
  repair; adopt on-disk versions with no row = `job_id` null protected; row with no artifact →
  `missing`, never dropped; orphaned `work/` swept only after), structural **`Verify`** branching
  on `Manifest.plist.IsEncrypted` (A1), **`RepairWorkingCopy`**, and retention **`Prune`**
  (post-commit + explicit, no scheduler); **`internal/storage/clonetree`** (one FICLONE/hardlink/
  copy cloner; hardlink copies `MutatesInPlace` classes); a **`versions` table + registry** in
  `internal/store` (the real `VersionReader`); **`DELETE /api/versions/{id}` → 202|404|503** + a
  `VersionAdmin` consumer interface + audit + `version.created`/`version.deleted` events; non-demo
  wiring that **reconciles before serving**; a `--demo` delete path; and **`deploy/storage.md`**
  (the constrained `quince-zfs-helper` forced-command + the anchored rclone filter block).
  **`make gates` + `make image` + `make gates-ui-e2e` green.** `-cover` wired into `gates-go`
  (the "when first needed" moment). **Coverage declared:** storage **78.3%**, clonetree **71.4%**,
  store **80.1%**, httpapi **71.8%**; **known-untested** (accepted debt, all low-risk or
  environment-gated): the reflink/FICLONE leaf (`clonetree` reflink path + the zfs reflink-mirror
  branch) — proven for-real in lab gate 12, skipped-with-a-log in CI (tmpfs has no FICLONE); the
  zfs reflink-from-snapshot copy-fallback branch; a few reconcile/adopt error-log branches; the
  `zfsCLI` list/destroy not-found guards. **Build finding fixed:** `WriteMarker` now replaces
  (remove-then-write) rather than truncates, so a hardlink-seeded `work/` can't rewrite a committed
  version's marker. **Lab gate 12 (real zfs on the host + iMazing-opens + syncoid-mid-write + the
  destructive hardlink-safety matrix) is the remaining physical/host step** — owned by this rung,
  not deferred. Not yet committed (awaiting Operator). Frontier stays **qn.5** until gate 12; then
  → **qn.4a** (engine; qn.4 split into qn.4a/qn.4b per (be)).
- 2026-07-20: (be) **qn.4 split into qn.4a / qn.4b** (Operator-ruled after a plan-shape review:
  the rung was three heterogeneous concerns wide — engine, Wi-Fi, CLI — unlike qn.5's
  one-subsystem depth). **qn.4a** = the transport-AGNOSTIC job engine + supervisor + the minimal
  headless CLI as the rung's own lab harness; CI replays ALL lab transcripts including the Wi-Fi
  torn sessions (the engine is Wi-Fi-shaped from day one); hardware gate = an encrypted USB
  backup driven from the CLI ending as a committed verified version + the engine kill matrix.
  **qn.4b** = Wi-Fi first-class + `transport: auto` + the intent-grouped job history API/UI +
  CLI completion (`versions verify`, `repair-working-copy` surface), closing M3 with the
  both-transports UI-driven gate incl. an injected Wi-Fi mid-backup disconnect landing honestly.
  **Explicitly NOT a Wi-Fi demotion** — ruling (h) stands: Wi-Fi keeps its own rung + hardware
  gate inside M3, before qn.7 and far before v0.1. The CLI was ruled NOT a separate milestone:
  standalone it is thin plumbing with no goal sentence, and splitting it would rob the engine
  rung of its driving interface (its bulk IS the engine working). Roadmap M3 + dashboard
  restructured; numbers stay labels (qn.2b precedent). The updated frontier chain: qn.5 gate 12
  → qn.4a → qn.4b.
- 2026-07-20: (bf) **gate-12 gap RULED: the zfs mirror probes for MEASURED sharing, not FICLONE
  success.** The gate's Operator-run core PASSED on real ZFS 2.4.3 (throwaway child dataset;
  create → snapshot → mirror → registry → `RepairWorkingCopy`, twice; **A1's encrypted `Verify`
  proven on the real ~34G encrypted tree** — committed without opening `Manifest.db`, exactly
  the CI-blind bug the amendment predicted) and surfaced two definitive findings: (1)
  reflink-from-snapshot = `EXDEV` (interface fact 2 answered; the designed clone-from-`working/`
  fallback stands); (2) **FICLONE succeeds WITHOUT sharing blocks on the real pool**
  (`block_cloning` active, `zfs_bclone_enabled=1`; verified three independent ways) — the
  "zero extra space" reflink premise is false there. Ruling: option (c) sharpened — the mirror
  strategy chain stays reflink → hardlink → copy, but the probe measures real physical-usage
  sharing; ineffective reflink is demoted, the hardlink strategy is the space candidate GATED
  on the 12c destructive matrix, and copy is the always-correct floor with its cost SURFACED
  (no silent fallback). Option (b) — offsite sync from `.zfs` paths — REJECTED: `snapdir=hidden`
  hides them from rclone, `snapdir=visible` uploads every snapshot at full size; D5a stands.
  Option (d) — root cause — demoted to a non-blocking side quest; first check: `zfs get
  encryption` on the pool datasets (BRT + native encryption has documented no-share
  restrictions — this may be known behavior, not a 2.4.x bug), then an upstream issue if it
  reproduces on an unencrypted dataset. Stack D5 amended.
- 2026-07-20: (bg) **the (bf) no-share verdict is PROVISIONAL — Operator challenged it, and
  there is a specific accounting trap that could fully explain the evidence.** ZFS charges
  BRT-cloned blocks like dedup: full size per reference at dataset level (`zfs list used`,
  `du`); the savings are visible ONLY at pool level (`zpool get
  bcloneused,bclonesaved,bcloneratio` / pool ALLOC delta). All three gate-12 measurements are
  consistent with WORKING clones misread through dataset accounting. Discriminator protocol
  (host-side, zero container layers, ~10 min): on the PVE host — `zfs create` a throwaway,
  `dd` a test file, `zpool sync`, note `bclonesaved` + pool ALLOC, GNU `cp --reflink=always`,
  `zpool sync`, re-read both. `bclonesaved` grows ~file-size → cloning WORKS, reflink
  reinstated, (bf)'s demotion reverses (the probe still moves to pool-level measurement —
  that part of the ruling stands regardless). Flat → the no-share finding is real; then `zfs
  get encryption` (BRT × native-encryption restriction) before any upstream filing. Also
  eliminate stack layers while at it: the original harness ran through container/bind paths —
  the re-measure runs on the host with GNU cp; note `zfs_bclone_wait_dirty=0` makes clones of
  UNSYNCED data fail (a Go fallback chain could silently copy) — hence the `zpool sync`
  before cloning. The EXDEV-from-snapshot finding is unaffected (cross-superblock FICLONE is
  kernel behavior no mount option changes; the clone-from-`working/` fallback stands). Remaining gate-12 legs: iMazing-opens
  (Operator GUI), syncoid mid-write (needs a replication target), the 12c matrix — with the
  iOS-upgrade leg marked OPPORTUNISTIC (runs at the next real update; a named trigger, not a
  blocker), the rest forceable now.
- 2026-07-20: (bh) **(bg)'s discriminator RUN by the Operator on the host — CLONING WORKS;
  reflink REINSTATED.** `bcloneused` 388M→788M (+400M = the test file), `bclonesaved`
  695M→1.07G, pool ALLOC flat at 391G; the baseline itself proves prior clones were already
  sharing on this pool. (bf)'s demotion reverses per (bg)'s pre-registered branch: the zfs
  `latest/` mirror keeps reflink (near-instant, zero extra pool space; the ~34G-per-commit
  copy price evaporates). What stands from (bf): the EXDEV-from-snapshot finding + the
  clone-from-`working/` fallback (the operative path), and the probe measuring REAL sharing
  at the POOL level — rung-local pick for qn.5: the `avail`-delta method needs only the
  hook's existing `list` verb, or extend the helper with read-only `zpool get bclone*`.
  Dataset-level `used` is documented as the trap (BRT bills like dedup). Option (d) side
  quest CLOSED: root cause = accounting semantics, nothing is broken, no upstream issue.
  Chain of custody worth recording: the gap protocol caught canon-vs-reality, and Operator
  skepticism then caught evidence-vs-instrumentation — without (bg), a dataset-`used` probe
  would have silently demoted a working reflink on every pool, forever.
- 2026-07-20: (bi) **the Operator's layer ladder caught the THIRD layer: unprivileged userns
  blocks FICLONE (`EPERM`) — mirror strategy RULED as a ladder with a host-side hook verb.**
  The qn.5 session's mandated re-verification (OCI → LXC → host, exact production mount shape)
  established: host shares fully (+4.3G bcloneused/saved, ALLOC flat); unprivileged LXC and
  the OCI container inside it get `EPERM` — so in-container reflink is unavailable in the
  recommended secure topology, and the session's original practical outcome (mirror costs a
  copy) was RIGHT for the wrong reason, twice removed. Its confirmations were exemplary:
  recomputed dataset-`used` predictions match all three original readings (the accounting trap
  fully explains finding #2), EXDEV-from-snapshot reproduces at every layer. RULING (option 1
  + option 2 as fallback; 3 rejected on security posture — privileged topologies simply fall
  out of the ladder naturally; 4 stays rejected per (bf)): the mirror ladder = (i) hook
  present → new constrained **`mirror` verb** rebuilds `latest/` HOST-side where FICLONE
  works (`cp -a --reflink=always` from `working/` under the job lock + atomic swap; children
  of the parent only; touches only the derived `latest/`, never snapshots — bounded blast
  radius since `latest/` is rebuildable); (ii) hookless → in-container reflink attempt with
  the pool-level probe; (iii) hardlink-under-matrix; (iv) copy, surfaced. Stack D5 amended;
  deploy/storage.md + the helper reference gain the verb (qn.5 folds); interface facts 1–2
  close with the full three-layer evidence. Investigation arc complete: canon-vs-reality →
  evidence-vs-instrumentation → layer-privilege; each round caught by a different mechanism
  (gap protocol / Operator skepticism / the Operator's layer ladder).
- 2026-07-20: (bj) **probe semantics refined (fourth Operator challenge: "how can a
  hookless container run a pool-level probe?"): the sharing measurement governs REPORTING,
  never selection.** A non-sharing FICLONE is functionally a copy (same correctness, same
  cost), so FICLONE-works suffices to select reflink — the EPERM case self-selects down the
  ladder; the measurement only decides the honest claim (zero-space verified / unverifiable
  in this topology / copy cost). Measurement channels, best-available: hook `list`
  avail-delta → delegated `zfs list -o avail` (exec mode) → syscall-only `statfs(2)`
  `f_bavail` delta around an incompressible test clone (no zfs binary needed; sync-and-settle
  for txg accounting lag) → none ⇒ report UNVERIFIED, never claim zero-space. Stack D5
  amended. This closes the reflink investigation: selection is now trivially safe, and
  honesty degrades gracefully with the deployment's observability.
- 2026-07-20: (bk) **(bj) corrected on the fifth Operator challenge ("hardlink seems
  better"): the measurement DOES inform selection — in exactly one direction.** (bj)'s
  "never worse than the fallback" compared only against copy and forgot hardlink sits above
  it. Corrected rule: the ladder orders by RISK dominance (reflink clones are independent;
  hardlinks alias — in-place mutation of `working/` would silently corrupt a hardlinked
  `latest/`, which is why hardlink is matrix-gated and why reflink outranks it wherever both
  share); the one selection edge is **measured-not-sharing reflink → fall through to
  hardlink-under-matrix** (downgrade-for-space allowed; blind upgrade into aliasing risk
  never). Channel-less deployments still prefer reflink on the risk asymmetry: worst case =
  copy COST reported "unverified" vs hardlink's worst case = silent latest/ corruption.
  Stack D5 amended. Investigation tally: five Operator challenges, five outcome changes.
- 2026-07-20: (bl) **qn.5 folds the mirror-ladder ruling into code + docs.** Implemented the
  stack D5 (bi)/(bj)/(bk) ladder in `internal/storage`: the zfs `latest/` mirror now ALWAYS
  clones from `working/` (never `.zfs` — EXDEV every layer), via **(i) hook `mirror` verb
  (host-side reflink + atomic swap, touches only the derived `latest/`, reports SHARED/COPIED)
  → (ii) in-container reflink → (iii) hardlink-under-matrix → (iv) copy**, self-selecting by
  risk dominance; an in-container reflink reports **UNVERIFIED** (no channel yet — statfs
  `f_bavail` is a documented follow-up) and never takes the risky measured-not-sharing→hardlink
  downgrade absent a channel; every mode + honest claim is surfaced (`MirrorReport` / logs /
  `LastMirror()` for health). `deploy/storage.md` + the `quince-zfs-helper` reference gain the
  `mirror` verb. Interface facts 1–2 closed with the three-layer evidence (block cloning works
  at the POOL level but EPERMs in the unprivileged userns; FICLONE-from-snapshot is EXDEV).
  `make gates-go` green (0 lint, race-clean; storage 78.7%); CI proves the fallthrough + the
  hook-verb argv (fake hook), the reflink-shares + host-side-hook paths prove on the lab (gate
  12). **Still uncommitted pending the Operator's ask** (the two CI-half commits stand). Remaining
  gate-12 legs (Operator-driven): the host-side `mirror` verb on the real rpool, iMazing-opens,
  syncoid mid-write, and the 12c destructive matrix (which validates the hardlink tier).
- 2026-07-20: (bm) **qn.5 CLOSED (CI-proven); lab gate 12's remaining hardware legs RE-HOMED to
  qn.4a** (Operator ruling — session cut off after the five-round mirror investigation). Landed on
  `main` in four commits: `285c40b` (storage backends + reconciliation) + `9a4511b` (docs (bd)/(be))
  + `7e34034` (mirror ladder + lab harness) + `3ce5bb1` (docs (bf)→(bl)). **Proven at close:** the
  whole storage subsystem in CI (11 stories + the reconciliation kill-matrix + the D5a anchored-
  filter contract; `make gates`/image/e2e green; coverage storage 78.7% / clonetree 71.4% / store
  80.1% / httpapi 71.8%), plus the real-zfs commit + encrypted `Verify` + the reflink/EPERM/EXDEV
  facts exercised on hardware during the gate-12 investigation ((bf)→(bk)). **NOT proven on
  hardware (re-homed, NOT silently dropped — the qn.2b→qn.7 no-orphan-gate precedent):** the
  host-side `mirror` verb on the real rpool, iMazing-opens, syncoid mid-write, and the 12c
  destructive hardlink-safety matrix. **Owner = qn.4a**, whose first real-backup hardware session
  runs qn.5's storage `Commit` on real traffic (the natural home); the legs are preserved verbatim
  in the qn.5 spec's gate-12 section. Interim note: the `hardlink` mirror/backend tier is
  matrix-unproven until 12c runs (the Operator's rpool uses the reflink hook path, so it isn't hit
  there); the pushed staging image is pre-mirror-ladder and needs a re-push before the qn.4a
  hardware session. Frontier → **qn.4a**.
- 2026-07-20: (bn) **gate-12 legs REDISTRIBUTED by affinity (Operator-ruled, amending (bm)'s
  all-to-qn.4a; a separate qn.4c was considered and rejected as a hollow-goal rung):**
  iMazing-opens + syncoid-mid-write + the live `mirror`-verb proof (`bclonesaved` observed
  moving) → **qn.4a's existing gate** — they are measurements taken during the backup that gate
  already produces, zero added sessions; the **12c destructive hardlink-safety matrix →
  qn.4b's gate** — its transitions (full→incremental, interrupted+next, encryption change;
  iOS-upgrade opportunistic) are engine products of qn.4b's repeated-backup session, where
  driving them costs nothing versus qn.4a's single-backup outing forcing manual rituals.
  Interim safety stands: the hardlink mirror/backend tier is disabled-to-copy (surfaced) until
  the matrix passes — the Operator's rpool runs the hook path and never hits it; ext4-NAS
  deployments get honest copy-mode meanwhile. Roadmap qn.4a/qn.4b gates updated.
- 2026-07-20: (bo) **`rpool/userdata` DECLASSIFIED (Operator ruling), closing the qn.4a-reported
  pattern hit.** The qn.4a build's privacy self-check surfaced that a pattern-list string sat in
  committed public files (a contracts §6 config example + two planning-era decisions-log entries)
  — missed by the (ad) scrub and invisible to the commit-time gate, which greps staged DIFFS
  only. Ruled: the dataset path is acceptable-public (default-pool naming, already implied by the
  public offsite-model narrative); the pattern is removed from the private list; docs and history
  stand; no incident. Standing lesson kept: the gate cannot see pre-existing lines — a
  whole-tree `privacy-scan-all` target remains available as a future hardening if a genuinely
  sensitive pattern is ever added. Bare hostnames/IPs/MACs remain firmly private.
- 2026-07-20: (bt) **qn.4a BUILT (CI) — the backup engine drives idevicebackup2 end-to-end.**
  *(Letter fix 2026-07-20: this entry was originally mislabeled (bp), colliding with the qn.4b
  spec-approval entry below. Every `(bp)` cross-reference in canon + code means that auto-absent
  ruling, so THIS build record was renumbered — to (bt), since (bs) was legitimately taken by the
  gate-15 hardware entry that landed meanwhile — rather than churn 20 references. Out of strict
  alpha order by design; a terminal build record.)*
  Cleared the pre-build spec-review gate: spec + Rule check → **architect APPROVED with three
  amendments (1 startup job-row reconciliation story + explicit two-reconciler order; 2 the
  `waiting_for_device` bound named `const`; 3 the sampler free-space / `disk_low` leg — the
  implementer's "A3", ACCEPTED) + two ratifications (the double-`Verify` stands; `transport:auto`
  stays deferred to qn.4b) + one correction (no rung numbers in the `auto` 422 API string)**, all
  folded in. Shipped: **`internal/backup`** — the `Job` state machine (per-UDID single-flight),
  the `idevicebackup2` streaming supervisor (argv/`setpgid`/group-kill), a transcript-grounded
  tolerant parser, the activity-sampler liveness (staged, passcode-paused, startup-grace, + A3
  free-space `disk_low` warning surfaced via `job.log`/`slog`, never a silent kill), preflight
  (presence + pairing + encryption policy + disk headroom + Seed), the Seed→`Verify`→`CommitJob`/
  `Discard` handoff, and **startup job-row reconciliation** (crash-orphans → `connection_lost`, a
  rolled-forward commit → `succeeded`, run AFTER storage reconciliation); a **`jobs` table +
  registry** in `internal/store` (real `JobReader`, cursor pagination); the **job command surface**
  (`POST /api/jobs` 202/409/422/404/503, `POST …/cancel`, `JobControl` consumer interface, `job.*`
  events) + contracts §1 error codes recorded; the **`quince backup` CLI** (`DriveToCompletion`)
  via a shared `cmd/quince` `buildLiveStack` (serve + CLI); and the **six lab transcripts** +
  meta + a fake-`idevicebackup2` replayer. `make gates`/image/e2e green. **Two RULINGS that drove
  the build (both rung-local, in the qn.4a spec):** (1) *the Wi-Fi torn session is a STALL, not an
  error line* — the lab's `Heartbeat(SleepyTime)` freezes output; the sampler's tree-activity
  timeout produces `connection_lost` (the discriminator vs a survivable silence is tree churn, not
  output); (2) *`idevicebackup2 backup <target>` writes into `<target>/<UDID>/`* while qn.5 expects
  the tree at the work dir — bridged by an engine-side **symlink adapter** (`<UDID>` → work dir),
  no qn.5 change, no tree copy, no committed-state mutation (verify-live on lab gate 15).
  **Coverage:** backup **83.2%**, store 80.8%, httpapi 72.2%, cmd/quince 11.0% (the CLI wiring is
  hardware-exercised); known-untested = the real-`idevicebackup2` argv/symlink-follow + `statfsFree`
  leaf (fake-covered in CI) + `buildLiveStack`/`backupCmd`. **Handoff review of qn.5: clean** (one
  minor — `CommitJob`'s verify-fail branch, now covered by story 6). **Lab gate 15 (real encrypted
  USB backup + kill-matrix + the re-homed gate-12 legs) owned by this rung** — the hardware
  session; NOT proven yet. **Landed on `main` (CI half); gate-15 findings land later as labeled
  commits** (Operator relaxed the usual land-after-hardware order for this rung). Frontier stays
  **qn.4a** until lab gate 15, then → **qn.4b**.
- 2026-07-20: (bp) **qn.4b spec APPROVED; the `auto`-when-absent edge RULED: refuse actionably.**
  Architect ratification of the spec's flagged proposal, encoded into design §4: `auto` resolves
  against current presence only; a device on neither transport → actionable 422, no job minted
  (a guessed transport would persist a dishonest `Job.transport` — the contract stores only
  concrete values; the frozen automation contract's `device_not_visible` no-go shows canon
  already thinks this way; and default-wifi-and-wait would contradict "prefers USB when
  plugged" the moment a cable appears). Explicit `usb`/`wifi` keeps start-then-connect. One
  spec amendment: design §4 DOES change (the absent clause was silent canon — now explicit;
  the spec's "nothing changes" docs line updates accordingly). Everything else approved as
  written, incl. the demo JobControl flip (its own qn.4a-named condition met), the CLI-only
  escape hatches, and the netmuxd started-not-supervised split (the qn.2→qn.2b precedent).
  The consolidated hardware day closes M3: qn.4a gate 15 (CLI USB + kill matrix +
  mirror/iMazing/syncoid) then qn.4b gate 11 (UI both-transports + honest Wi-Fi disconnect) +
  gate 12c (the destructive matrix) in one Operator session.
- 2026-07-20: (bq) **BUG (Operator-found, assigned to qn.4b): Dashboard DeviceCard "Pair"
  navigates without opening the pairing dialog.** Clicking Pair on a dashboard device card
  routes to `/devices/{udid}` (`ui/.../DeviceCard.tsx:88`, a bare `<Link>`) and stops there —
  the user must find + click Pair again. Root cause: qn.3 correctly moved pairing to the
  details page (USB-only, narrated Trust + passcode) but wired the card as a plain navigation,
  not an intent. Expected: clicking Pair *initiates* pairing. Fix (assigned to qn.4b — it is
  already rewiring this exact action row for the live "Back up now" affordance): deep-link the
  navigation with a pair intent (query param or router state) that the details page reads to
  **auto-open the pair dialog** on arrival — keeps qn.3's "narrated flow lives on details"
  decision, just makes the click deliver on its label. Same pattern applies to any future
  card action that lives as a dialog on details. Small; no contract change.
- 2026-07-20: (br) **qn.4b BUILT (CI) — Wi-Fi first-class + transport policy + job-history UI; M3's
  CI half closed.** Cleared the pre-build spec-review gate ((bp)): spec + Rule check → architect
  APPROVED, with the flagged `auto`-when-absent edge **ratified as canon** (refuse actionably, design
  §4). **Handoff review of qn.4a: CLEAN** (no blocker/major; `make gates` green on the inherited tip,
  the consumed seams re-run verbose; one minor coverage finding — the shipped-unexercised
  `wifi-incremental-success`/`encryption-changed` transcripts — **retired** here by a Wi-Fi-success
  story). Shipped: **transport `auto` resolution** in `backup.Engine` (`resolveTransport` — prefer
  USB when present else Wi-Fi, store the CONCRETE `usb`/`wifi` on the `Job` never `"auto"`, absent →
  actionable **422** with no job minted; explicit `usb`/`wifi` keep the start-then-connect wait) +
  httpapi passes `auto` through; the **`quince versions verify <id>|--udid`** + **`quince device

  named condition — an e2e that posts jobs — is now met); and the **UI** (live "Back up now" with a
  transport override when on both, one-tap **Retry** on failed intent groups carrying `retry_of`,
  **Cancel** on the running job; details page + dashboard card; assisted narration, honest disabled
  states, no fabricated progress). **Folded the (bq) DeviceCard bug fix** (Operator-found, assigned
  to this rung): the dashboard card's **Pair** now deep-links a pair *intent* (react-router state)
  that **auto-opens the pairing dialog** on the details page — the click delivers on its label, and
  qn.3's narrated-flow-on-details decision stands (no contract change; a Run()-seeded unpaired demo
  device + an e2e assertion prove card Pair → dialog visible). **`make gates` + `make image` +
  `make gates-ui-e2e` green**; new
  e2e **story 4** (Back up now → live cancel → retry a failed backup, all against `--demo`). CI Go
  stories: `auto`→concrete + both→USB, `auto`-absent→422-no-job, Wi-Fi success replay (retires the
  finding), retry-chain, cancel, demo single-flight/cancel/retry, `versions verify` good/torn/unknown.
  **Coverage:** backup **83.4%**, demo **55.3%** (was 0), storage **78.2%**, httpapi 72.2%,
  cmd/quince 8.5%; **known-untested** (accepted debt): the `cmd/quince` CLI command wiring
  (`versions`/`device` verbs + `buildStorage` — the storage/engine logic they call is tested; the
  verbs are hardware/integration-exercised), the demo `waitStep` shutdown-`stop` branch, and the
  storage reflink leaf (unchanged from qn.5). Contracts §1's `auto` note updated to "implemented"
  (docs-part-of-the-diff). **NOT proven on hardware — the consolidated hardware day (architect note,
  (bp)):** qn.4a gate 15 (CLI USB + kill-matrix + mirror/iMazing/syncoid) → **qn.4b gate 11**
  (UI-driven backup over **both** transports + an injected Wi-Fi mid-backup disconnect landing
  `connection_lost`) + **gate 12c** (the destructive hardlink-safety matrix), one Operator session;
  the Wi-Fi legs need netmuxd *running* (started for the session — the binary ships since qn.0;
  co-supervision stays qn.7). Frontier stays **qn.4b** until the hardware day; **M3 closes then.**
  **Landed on `main` (CI half)** per the qn.4a relaxed-order precedent; the lab gate 11/12c findings land later as labeled commits.
- 2026-07-20: (bs) **qn.4a LAB GATE 15 — the engine legs PASSED on real hardware (iPad15,7, iOS 26.5).**
  The CLI-USB + kill-matrix half of gate 15 (the UI-driven both-transports backup moved to qn.4b
  gate 11 per (br); the mirror/iMazing/syncoid zfs legs deferred, below). Driven on the qn.2b/qn.3
  staging CT (managed usbmuxd, live `/dev/bus/usb`, `hardlink` `/backups`); the qn.4a image
  re-pushed as `quince:staging` + redeployed. **Proven end-to-end, both encryption variants:** (1)
  an UNENCRYPTED `quince backup` → committed structure-verified version — qn.5's **unencrypted
  `Verify` branch ran on a real 102 MB plaintext `Manifest.db`** (opened read-only, tables + sampled
  records → blobs), which CI had only faked; (2) after enabling encryption via the pty CLI, an
  ENCRYPTED backup → **A1's encrypted `Verify` branch on real encrypted data** (`Manifest.db` header
  is NOT SQLite-magic + 256 blob shards, verified WITHOUT opening the DB), `encrypted:true`;
  **version rotation** proven (encrypted → `latest/`, unencrypted → `versions/<ts>/`). **Interface
  fact 1 CONFIRMED live** — the real `idevicebackup2` follows the `<target>/<UDID>` **symlink
  adapter** into the qn.5 work dir (2.8 GB landed through it). **Interface fact 5 CONFIRMED** — the
  `backup` child argv/env carries NO password; the device's keybag encrypts (the password set once
  over the `encryption on` pty stayed masked — never in argv/env/logs/context; secrets discipline
  held). **Kill-matrix (backing_up) PASSED:** a hard `SIGKILL` of quince mid-`backing_up` left the
  committed versions **untouched** (never-mutate invariant held under a real crash); on restart,
  reconciliation **swept the orphaned 3.1 GB work dir + flipped the job → `connection_lost`, no
  phantom version** (storage `Scan` → engine job-row, the two-reconciler order). `verifying` is
  equivalent (pre-commit); the `committing` **roll-forward** is CI-proven (story 13) and impractical
  to time on the sub-second hardlink commit — declared, not hardware-run.
  **DEFERRED (named, not dropped) — the zfs legs** (host `mirror` verb / `bclonesaved` moving /
  iMazing-opens / syncoid mid-write): they need the rpool **hook-mode** topology (a forced-command
  SSH credential + a CT mount reconfig with `rbind,rslave`) — disproportionate production-host setup
  for incremental value, since the core zfs facts (reflink/EPERM/EXDEV, `bclonesaved` sharing) are
  already hardware-proven on this exact rpool in gate-12 ((bf)→(bk)). Operator ruling: wind down +
  record; run the zfs legs in a later dedicated session. The **syncoid receive target is prepped**
  on the offsite PVE host (specifics in `local/environment.md`; reachable from the workstation + the
  lab host over the existing inter-host path — no new key needed). (Aside: that host currently runs
  its pools DEGRADED on a known-dropped NVMe — Operator-accepted, to be fixed in person.)
  **FOUR lab findings surfaced + filed as tasks** (invisible to the CI fakes — the gate did its
  job): (i) `deviceops.willEncrypt` maps an ABSENT `WillEncrypt` key (exit-0, empty — a device that
  never set a backup password) to `"unknown"` not `"off"`, so the Manage-encryption UI asks for a
  *current* password on an unencrypted device + the off-warning banner never shows; (ii) **[FIXED 2026-07-20]** `quince
  backup <udid> --transport usb` failed — Go's `flag` stopped at the positional udid, so `--transport`
  was dropped → usage error (CI called `StartBackup()` directly, bypassing arg parsing). Fixed:
  extracted a pure `parseBackupArgs` with a multi-parse loop that honours flags before OR after the
  positional; red→green `TestParseBackupArgs` in `cmd/quince` (coverage 8.5%→14.9%); (iii) the
  version card's `Unlock` button (`ui/src/features/versions/VersionList.tsx:31-33` — a `disabled` qn.8
  placeholder) renders on EVERY version incl. unencrypted ones, implying a password gate an
  unencrypted backup doesn't have; fix = encryption-aware on `version.encrypted` (already used for the
  `unencrypted` badge, contracts §2 / `ui/src/lib/types.ts`): encrypted → `Unlock` (password → browse),
  unencrypted → `Browse` (direct read, no password), per design §7 (unlock is encrypted-only) — inert
  today so UI-polish / qn.8-area, not a functional defect; (iv) the device card lingers on "Backing up 100%" through verify+commit and doesn't
  reflect `device.last_backup` (check the engine sets it on success). (iii)/(iv) may be subsumed by
  qn.4b's landed job-history/backup UI (br) — dedup at fix time. **(v) CONFIRMED + root-caused
  (2026-07-20 zfs session):** `device.last_backup` is populated **only in the `demo` provider**
  (`internal/demo/{script,jobcontrol,fixtures}.go` `refreshLastBackup`) — the REAL path (engine
  `Commit` success + `wire.Device` serialization from the live registry/store) never writes it, so a
  paired device with committed versions shows **"No backups yet"** on the card while the version list
  right below shows them (Operator screenshot: 5 versions — 3 `zfs incremental · structure verified`,
  2 `hardlink` — under a "No backups yet" card). This proves (iv)'s hypothesis; fix = the engine sets
  `device.last_backup {at,job,status}` on commit success (or the device DTO derives it from the latest
  committed version) — dedup with qn.4b's backup UI (br). **(vi) GitHub Actions CI RED on `main` —
  root-caused + fixed (2026-07-20).** Only the `e2e` job failed (`gates`+`image` green), on bu+bv+a
  re-run: the two qn.4b **story4** Playwright tests time out waiting for the demo devices
  `spare-iphone` + `new-iphone` to appear. Root cause: `demo.deviceChurn` reset `p.order` to a
  hardcoded `[phone]`/`[phone,pad]` every 20 s, wiping the on-demand devices `seedOnDemandDevice`
  had appended at `Run()` — so story4 passed only if it ran inside the first 20 s (green at bq on a
  fast runner; reliably red once the runner scheduled story4 later). NOT a code regression (main
  unchanged since bq) — a latent demo bug CI timing finally exposed. **Fix:** churn toggles only the
  pad in `p.order` (new `removeUDID` helper), preserving phone + on-demand devices; stories 1–3 only
  assert phone/pad so they're unaffected. Verified by reading (no local Go toolchain) — CI confirms on
  the next push. **Observations (not bugs):** both
  runs came out `kind:incremental` — `idevicebackup2` did device-relative differentials, and the
  encryption change did NOT force a full backup on this iPad (unlike the lab-log iPhone) → a real
  product question (should the engine pass `--full` on the first backup / after an encryption
  change?); an unencrypted backup on an already-paired, unlocked device needed **no on-device
  passcode** (a D13 nuance — the "every backup" claim looks encryption/Trust-specific); startup
  reconciliation took **~7 s** (storage `Scan` walks `/backups`) — a scaling note for large stores.
  **qn.4a's engine goal — the M3 engine half — is hardware-proven.**
- 2026-07-20: (bu) **decisions-log letter hygiene (two collisions in one review — a process fix).**
  Concurrent appenders (architect + a hardware session + a build session) each guessed "next
  letter" and produced duplicate `(bp)` then `(bs)`. Rule going forward: **letters are cross-reference
  anchors, not sequence guarantees** — on a collision, the *unreferenced* side renumbers to the next
  free letter (grep `^- 2026-07-20: (b?)` first) and leaves a one-line breadcrumb; the *referenced*
  side never moves (churns canon + code). A build/close record out of strict alpha order is fine — a
  reader follows references, not the alphabet. (Fixes this session: (bp)-dup → the qn.4a build record
  became (bt); (bs) stayed the gate-15 entry that owns it.)
- 2026-07-20: (bv) **ownership resolved: qn.4a owns the deferred zfs-hook legs — and the plan
  ambiguity that caused the dispute is fixed.** Operator-flagged: qn.4a's session read the zfs work
  as "deferred to a later session, not mine," while the architect read gate 15(a) ("commit on the
  real zfs backend") as qn.4a-owned. **Both defensible — the plan conflated two things:** gate
  15(a) demanded a zfs-backend commit, but the session validly proved the engine on the `hardlink`
  backend and bundled everything zfs-specific into a deferred pile that enumerated only the
  mirror/iMazing/syncoid extras — never listing **engine→commit-on-zfs** itself, leaving it in a
  seam owned by no named rung ("a later dedicated session" ≠ a rung). **Ruling (Operator): qn.4a
  owns the whole zfs half** (it already holds the topology details — cheaper than re-teaching a
  fresh session); deferred ≠ reassigned, the rung finishes its own gate. **Ambiguity fixed:** the
  pending zfs half is now enumerated explicitly — **engine→commit on the real zfs-hook backend**
  (the implicit item) + host `mirror` verb + `bclonesaved` live + iMazing + syncoid — in the qn.4a
  spec status, the dashboard row, and here. Low risk (both halves independently hardware-proven —
  qn.5's lab harness committed a real 34 GB backup through the zfs backend, qn.4a proved the
  engine→backend handoff on hardlink; only their composition on zfs is unrun). Blocks nothing;
  runs when the Operator stands up the rpool hook topology (likely with qn.4b's gate 11/12c —
  one hook-topology setup serves both). Also fixed en route: the qn.4a dashboard row was stale
  ("Not committed") — reconciled to reflect the landed CI half + the hardware-proven engine legs.
- 2026-07-20: (bw) **qn.4a zfs half PROVEN on real hardware — the engine drives a committed,
  verified version on the real zfs-hook backend, end-to-end.** Stood up the deferred (bv) topology on
  the lab rpool: a throwaway parent dataset, a constrained `quince-zfs-helper` forced-command SSH key
  (create/snapshot/destroy/list/mirror; dataset-destroy + parent-escape both refused, verified), the
  per-device child dataset `rbind,rslave`-propagated host→LXC→container (a host-side `zfs create`
  appears live at `/backups/<udid>`), `storage.backend: zfs, mode: hook`. **The zfs legs (gate
  15(a)+(d), (bv) enumeration):** (a) **engine→commit on zfs** — `quince backup` drove
  `queued→…→succeeded` on the zfs backend; an ENCRYPTED backup (on-device keybag; Manifest carries
  `ManifestKey`+`BackupKeyBag`), the `verifying` state ran A1's Verify on the committed tree,
  `committing` cut the version snapshot `<ds>@quince-<versionID>` (~3.1 GB refer), `latest/`
  reflink-mirrored. (d) **host `mirror` verb + `bclonesaved` live** — the verb ran on the real rpool
  (`mode: hook-reflink`, "zero-space verified"); pool `bclonesaved` moved **+~3 GB** (measured `zpool
  get bclonesaved`, the pool-level way — [[zfs-reflink-clone-facts]], never dataset `used`). (d)
  **syncoid mid-write** — while a second backup was actively writing `working/`, a syncoid pass
  replicated the child dataset to the offsite PVE host: both committed `@quince-*` restore points
  intact (refer matched, working+latest trees present) + a sync-snap captured the dirty in-flight
  `working/`. Offsite replication is safe during an active backup. (d) **iMazing-opens** stays an
  Operator-GUI leg — flagged, not agent-verifiable. **Deploy-doc bugs (surface only once hook mode is
  actually stood up — nobody had; all fixed in `deploy/storage.md`):** (1) the reference helper read
  `target="$2"`, but quince sends the dataset LAST (`create -p <ds>`, `list … -r <ds>`) → it REFUSED
  create+list; now last-arg. (2) the stock image ships no ssh client that `hook_cmd` needs; documented.
  (3) a host-created dataset is root-owned → the unprivileged-userns container can't write `working/`;
  the `create` verb now chowns to the container's mapped uid. Documented the two-hop (LXC + OCI)
  `rbind,rslave` propagation too. **willEncrypt finding strengthened (backlog (bs)-(i)):** `unknown`
  also arises from a COLD-lockdown enrichment race, not only an absent key → preflight hard-fails
  `encryption_required` with no retry even on a device that WILL encrypt; the storage legs set
  `require_encryption: false` (device still encrypts) to test storage, not re-litigate pairing.
  **qn.4a zfs half CLOSED — only iMazing-opens (Operator GUI) remains.** M3's engine goal is now
  hardware-proven on BOTH backends: hardlink engine legs (bs), zfs half (bw).
- 2026-07-20: (bx) **qn.4a close review (architect): clean + strong — two real bugs given a rung
  home.** Verified the (bw) close: zfs half genuinely proven (the (bv) engine→commit-on-zfs seam
  discharged — mirror verb `bclonesaved` +~3 GB pool-level, syncoid mid-write), three deploy-doc
  hook bugs found+fixed on the first real hook-mode stand-up, letters unique, privacy clean, CI
  green on main (the (vi) e2e fix landed). The gap: two of the six lab findings are genuine v0.1-
  quality defects in landed code but were only task-chips with no rung owner — now **assigned to
  qn.4b** (its gate-11 real backup re-exercises both, and (v) already pointed there): **(i)** the
  `willEncrypt`→`unknown` mis-map on unencrypted devices (asks for a non-existent current password,
  no unencrypted-warning banner) + the cold-lockdown enrichment race that hard-fails a legitimate
  encrypted backup at preflight; **(v)** `device.last_backup` written only by the demo provider, so
  a device with real committed versions shows "No backups yet". Findings (iii)/(iv) stay UI-polish
  (subsumed by (v)/qn.4b's UI); (ii)/(vi) already fixed+landed. iMazing-opens rides the qn.4b
  hardware day (30-second Operator GUI check).
- 2026-07-20: (by) **DAILY-DRIVER TARGET set; qn.4b closed (CI); `qn.4c` inserted; netmuxd
  supervision pulled forward; gate 12c deferred past a planned code freeze** (Operator ruling).
  The Operator is heading for a **code freeze + process revamp**, but wants a *personally
  usable* quince first, defined as: **full backup cycle over BOTH transports + live progress
  without a page refresh + the major bugs fixed.** Mapping that to work exposed one unassigned
  piece — **netmuxd co-supervision**. It is genuinely required for *usable* (not merely for the
  proof): nothing starts netmuxd on `compose up`, so Wi-Fi is silently dead after every restart
  and unrecovered on any crash — precisely the qn.2b-for-usbmuxd situation. It is also a modest
  lift: `internal/muxsup` is hardware-proven and structurally generic, needing its hardcoded
  `usbmuxd -f -S <socket>` + **unix-socket** probe generalized to netmuxd's argv + **TCP** probe.
  **Ruled:** (1) **qn.4b CLOSED (CI half landed, complete)** — no session work remains; its
  **gate 11 re-homes to qn.4c** with a named owner (the qn.2b-gate-8→qn.7 pattern), which is
  *more correct*, not merely convenient: gate 11's Wi-Fi leg then runs on **supervised** netmuxd
  — the shape actually deployed — instead of a hand-started one proving a topology nobody runs.
  (2) **New rung `qn.4c`** = netmuxd co-supervision (moved out of qn.7) + qn.4a findings
  (i)/(iv)/(v) (re-pointed from qn.4b), inheriting gate 11. (3) **Gate 12c DEFERRED past the
  freeze** — the destructive hardlink matrix gates a backend the Operator does not run (zfs
  deployment); the hardlink tier stays disabled-to-copy and surfaced, which is already the safe
  interim ((bn)). (4) qn.7 keeps the patched-timeout build, restart-policy tuning, chaos suite,
  liveness thresholds, and the audition — all deferred past the freeze. **No handover session
  was needed for qn.4b:** its worktree was verified to hold ZERO uncommitted work and its branch
  was identical to `main` — the repo (spec + rung report + dashboard + log) *is* the handover,
  which is what the documentation discipline was for. Remaining path to the freeze point:
  **one fresh session (qn.4c) + one hardware day.**
- 2026-07-20: (bz) **qn.4c spec APPROVED; three architect rulings + the netmuxd socket hazard.**
  The spike's headline is a landmine caught by running the shipped binary (the "interface facts
  are looked up" rule earning its keep **again**): with its default `--socket-path`, **netmuxd
  DELETES a live usbmuxd's unix socket and binds its own** — reproduced in the built image
  (`Deleting old Unix socket`, usbmuxd still running with its inode gone = **silent USB
  blackout**). Naive supervision would have made enabling Wi-Fi kill USB. Ruled argv:
  `netmuxd --host <h> --port <p> --socket-path <private> --disable-usb`, with a **loud refusal**
  if that path collides with `devices.usbmuxd_socket`; the session's choice of a private socket
  over `--disable-unix` is **ratified** — the latter puts netmuxd in host mode where it depends
  on usbmuxd being alive, coupling Wi-Fi health to USB health, which is exactly backwards for
  two independent transports. **Rulings:** (1) **`last_backup.job_id` → NULLABLE: APPROVED**,
  landed in contracts §2 ahead of the rung (the qn.2b precedent). Deriving `last_backup` from
  the newest committed VERSION rather than job history is *more correct*: versions are the source
  of truth for "has this device been backed up", so it survives restarts and covers **adopted**
  versions (restored/replicated dataset — the case where "No backups yet" is most insulting),
  which honestly have no job. Semantic shift recorded: `last_backup` now means the last
  SUCCESSFUL backup; a failed last attempt lives in the job history, not here. (2) **One config
  flag: APPROVED** — D12 says config tidiness is a feature, and a second flag would serve a
  topology nobody has asked for while the mixed case still degrades *honestly* via refuse-loudly.
  If a real user ever needs it, one bool splits into two as a compatible migration
  (`manage_muxer: true` → both). (3) **Health shape: CLEAN BREAK recommended** — a `muxers`
  array (each entry naming its role/transport, managed state, and whether rescan applies)
  INSTEAD of keeping the singular `muxer` alongside it. Two overlapping representations rot
  (which is truth when they disagree?), and a top-level `muxer` is now *ambiguous* with two
  daemons; `/api/health` is not frozen and we are the only consumer, so this is the cheapest
  moment. Update any `local/` tooling that greps `.muxer.` in the same pass. **Affirmed:**
  rescan stays USB-only (restarting netmuxd would tear a live Wi-Fi backup — and rescan always
  existed for USB hotplug). **Flagged for the build:** verify finding (iv) is *genuinely*
  subsumed by (v) — if the card has no branch rendering the `verifying`/`committing` phases it
  will still read "Backing up 100%" after `last_backup` is fixed, which would be a small but
  real UI change contradicting "ui/ needs no changes".
- 2026-07-20: (ca) **mDNS-across-the-container-bridge named as an unproven dependency (qn.4c) —
  and it is the Wi-Fi twin of accepted proposal P1.** netmuxd discovers Wi-Fi devices ONLY by
  mDNS; both shipped compose examples run bridged with a published port, multicast does not
  cross that bridge, and **no gate has ever proven Wi-Fi device presence inside the container**.
  So supervising netmuxd may be **necessary but not sufficient** on the shipped deployment shape.
  The session named it rather than assuming it (host networking as the deploy answer, macvlan as
  the alternative) and gate 11(b) settles it on hardware in minutes — the right call. Two
  additions: (a) whatever the gate finds, the Wi-Fi networking requirement is a **first-class
  deployment constraint** in `deploy/`, not a footnote — and if host networking is the answer,
  its security tradeoff (shared network namespace vs. the hardened-profile story) is documented
  honestly; (b) "netmuxd running" ≠ "Wi-Fi works" — a netmuxd that runs while multicast never
  reaches it sees zero devices forever, which is **exactly the shape of accepted proposal P1**
  (a muxer that runs but cannot open devices → actionable onboarding/health warning). The Wi-Fi
  twin should land with P1 in qn.6, or at minimum be recorded beside it.
- 2026-07-21: (cb) **qn.4c BUILT (CI) — netmuxd is co-supervised, and the three "it looks broken"
  defects are gone.** The rung's CI half is complete; only the inherited hardware day (gate 11)
  remains. **Supervision:** `internal/muxsup` now describes any muxer daemon as a `Spec`
  (name/role/argv/probe-network/address/rescan-applies) and a `Group` runs the two-daemon topology;
  `cmd/quince`'s pure `plannedMuxers` resolves `devices.manage_muxer` + the two addresses into
  supervise/dial/refuse decisions (table-tested). The qn.2b guarantees — own process group,
  restart-with-capped-backoff, crash-loop → degraded, refuse-loudly on an already-served address,
  killed on shutdown — are now **parameterized over a unix-socket AND a TCP daemon**, so netmuxd
  inherits proof rather than just code. **The argv is load-bearing** ((bz)): `--host/--port` from
  `devices.netmuxd_addr`, a **private `--socket-path`** (netmuxd deletes and rebinds whatever socket
  it names — with the default that is the live usbmuxd's, i.e. a silent USB blackout), and
  `--disable-usb` (D2's USB anchor until qn.7's audition); a derived path colliding with
  `devices.usbmuxd_socket` makes quince **refuse to supervise netmuxd** loudly while still dialing
  it. **Health took the clean break**: `muxers:[{name,role,managed,state,detail,rescan}]` replaces
  the singular `muxer`; rescan stays **USB-only** (restarting netmuxd would tear a live Wi-Fi
  backup). **Findings:** (i)-A `willEncrypt` maps exit-0-with-empty-output to **`off`** (an absent
  key IS the device saying it will not encrypt; `unknown` now means a genuine read failure);
  (i)-B **preflight re-reads the encryption state live** (`deviceops.RefreshEncryption`, reusing
  qn.3's non-auto-pairing `Info`) whenever the cached value is not `on` — the cold-lockdown
  hard-fail is gone, a fresh `off` still refuses actionably, and a still-`unknown` refuses with the
  TRUE reason instead of implying the user disabled encryption (proceeding-on-unknown was
  considered and rejected: discovering it after writing GBs is worse); (v) **`last_backup` derives
  from the newest non-missing committed version** through an injected source read at merge time
  (no cache to go stale — right after a restart, right for adopted versions, right after a delete),
  plus `AnnounceBackup` on commit success for the live card update; (iv) **verified subsumed by
  running, not assumed** (the architect's build flag) — a new `DeviceCard` test drives
  backing_up(100%) → verifying → committing and shows the card already narrates each, so the only
  missing piece was the last-backup line. **Gates:** `make gates` + `make image` +
  `make gates-ui-e2e` green in quince-dev (e2e 6/6, incl. a new story: a dashboard-card backup runs
  to success and the card lands on its real last-backup line **with no reload**). **Image smoke
  test (the CI-side proof of the rung's promise):** `quince serve` in the image built this rung
  reports both daemons `running` with the exact ruled argv, **both sockets coexisting**, TCP 27015
  listening; a `kill -9` of the netmuxd child was **respawned by the supervisor** while usbmuxd
  kept its original pid and a live socket (`idevice_id -l` exit 0). Coverage: muxsup **86.9%**,
  device 97.8%, backup 83.8%, cmd/quince 20.9% (was 14.9), httpapi 72.0%, deviceops 80.3%.
  **Deploy ((ca) discharged in advance of the gate):** the Wi-Fi/mDNS requirement is a first-class
  header section in `compose.nas.yml` (host-networking answer, its honest isolation tradeoff, and
  macvlan as the isolation-preserving alternative); `compose.lab.yml` documents the host-run netmuxd
  equivalent incl. the `--socket-path` warning; **P1b** records the Wi-Fi twin of P1 in the
  proposals ledger for qn.6. **One pre-existing finding filed (out of scope, has a home):** a job's
  row goes terminal before its work is discarded and the single-flight slot released, so an instant
  Retry can hit a 409 that says "a backup is already running" — correct refusal, misleading words;
  the smallest fix is a distinct reason string. **Remaining: lab gate 11 (a)–(h), one Operator
  hardware day** — both transports UI-driven with live progress, Wi-Fi on SUPERVISED netmuxd
  surviving a container restart, honest mid-backup disconnect, the real last-backup line on a
  device with pre-existing versions, encryption honesty, secrets absence, iMazing-opens. It also
  settles whether the deployed bridged shape sees Wi-Fi devices at all, or needs host networking.
- 2026-07-21: (cc) **qn.4c close review (architect): approved — and the terminal/slot-release race
  gets a rung home.** The build discharged both review flags honestly: (iv) was *checked* rather
  than assumed (a `DeviceCard` test drives `backing_up(100%)→verifying→committing`; the card
  already narrates each, so `ui/` genuinely needed no component change — the session noted it
  would have claimed that wrongly without the check), and (ca) landed in the deploy docs ahead of
  the gate. Ruling 3 was taken as recommended (clean-break `muxers` array, no singular `muxer`;
  `local/environment.md`'s runbook line swept in the same pass). **The standout: the netmuxd
  takeover hazard is verified ABSENT in the shipped image** — both sockets coexisting, `kill -9`
  netmuxd respawning while usbmuxd keeps its pid and a live socket (`idevice_id -l` exit 0). That
  is proof, not design-around. **Pre-existing defect, NOT fixed here (correctly — out of scope),
  now OWNED:** a job's row goes terminal *before* its work is discarded and the per-UDID
  single-flight slot is released, so an instant one-tap **Retry can get 409 "a backup is already
  running"** — a correct refusal wearing misleading words, sitting exactly under qn.4b's Retry
  button (D13's core flow). It is a **state-honesty** bug (the truth is "the previous run is still
  cleaning up"), but narrow: the window is the `Discard`, which is near-nil on zfs (dirty
  `working/` is left in place) and only long on namespace backends removing a big work dir.
  **Ruled: NOT daily-driver-blocking** (intermittent and below the Operator's stated bar of
  constant visible wrongness) → **owner = qn.7** (hardening, post-freeze), **with a pull-forward
  trigger: if it bites during gate 11, fix it there as a labeled lab-finding commit** (the
  established pattern). The session's handling was exemplary — it surfaced the race by making a
  test flaky under load, then made the test *wait the window out with a comment naming the cause*
  rather than hiding it.
- 2026-07-21: (cd) **qn.4c GATE-11 LAB FINDING — the backup target stub must live on the storage
  filesystem; fixed as a lab-finding commit.** The first real full backup (iPhone, ~40 GB, USB via
  USB-over-IP) failed three times in ~30–60 s with zero bytes and `idevicebackup2 failed: exit
  status 151`, phase `waiting_for_passcode`, despite the passcode being entered every time — while
  the iPad's Wi-Fi incremental had just succeeded, so it read as "USB is broken". **Root cause,
  proven both directions on the device within minutes:** mobilebackup2 asks the HOST for its free
  space, and `idevicebackup2` answers with a `statfs` of **the target directory it was handed** —
  it does NOT follow the `<UDID>` symlink into the work dir. quince passed
  `$QUINCE_CACHE/backup-targets/<jobID>` (a 26 GB filesystem on staging), so the phone was told
  26 GB, needed ~40 GB, and refused with `ErrorCode 105: Insufficient free disk space
  (MBErrorDomain/105)` → **exit 151**. A raw run with the target on the storage filesystem (546 GB)
  went straight into `Receiving files`. The iPad passed only because an incremental's delta fits in
  26 GB. **Gate-blocking, in landed qn.4a code:** any device whose backup exceeds the cache
  filesystem could never be backed up — every real iPhone. **Fix:** the stub is derived from the
  work dir (`<dir of workDir>/.quince-targets/<jobID>`), quince-writable on every backend and
  always on the storage filesystem; `ToolConfig.TargetRoot` REMOVED (a knob whose wrong value
  silently breaks large backups should not exist). Note the engine's old `<backups>/…` default would
  ALSO have failed under the zfs hook profile — the parent dataset root is root-owned, only
  per-device children are chowned. **Second fix, same finding:** a failed job now reports the tool's
  own last error line (`backup failed: Insufficient free disk space…`) instead of the exit status —
  the bare code made three identical failures indistinguishable, and 151==105 is documented
  nowhere upstream. **Fixtures first (hard rule):** `disk-full-105.{txt,meta.json}` (scrubbed real
  capture) + `TestPrepareTargetLivesBesideTheWorkDir` + `TestFailedBackupReportsTheDeviceReason`.
  **Process note:** the Operator predicted this failure mode from the `/cache` path before the run
  ("I'm afraid there might be a faulty free-space probe inside ibackup2 because /cache is on
  rootfs") — the diagnosis was then run-anchored, not argued: a raw `idevicebackup2` into a
  throwaway scratch dir on each filesystem, which is the qn.2b raw-run guard doing its job.
  **Session backlog (filed, not blocking):** crash-orphaned stub dirs unswept by reconciliation;
  the passcode narration unreachable in practice (the phase is learned in the same breath as the
  failure); two `latest` badges until reload (client-side staleness, server verified correct).
- 2026-07-22: (ce) **qn.4c LAB GATE 11 — the DAILY-DRIVER bar is met on real hardware; 6 of 8 legs
  passed, 1 mislabelled, 1 declared unrunnable.** One Operator hardware day on the staging CT
  (managed profile, zfs hook backend, real iPhone 16 Pro + iPad). **PASSED:** **(b) Wi-Fi from the
  browser on SUPERVISED netmuxd** — `compose up` alone brought both muxers up; a pre-flight proved
  the only netmuxd on the box was the container's supervised child with the ruled argv (a
  hand-started leftover was found squatting on 27015 and retired first — refuse-loudly would
  otherwise have made the gate prove nothing, exactly the (by) concern). An encrypted incremental
  committed, then a device's **first-ever full backup — 33.3 GB — committed over the same path** at
  a measured **16–24 MiB/s**; Wi-Fi beat the Operator's USB path, which was VirtualHere USB-over-IP
  across the same Wi-Fi. **(a) USB from the browser** — a cabled incremental committed, with
  `transport: auto` **resolving to USB because the cable was plugged** (qn.4b policy, first hardware
  proof), no `-n`, the supervised usbmuxd socket, and the lab-finding target fix live in argv.
  **(c) survives a restart** (the redeploy: both daemons back unaided, device back on `wifi`,
  backup immediately after). **(e) real last-backup line** on a device with pre-existing versions.
  **(g) secrets** — `BACKUP_PASSWORD` count 0 and no password in argv, captured live on BOTH
  transports. **(h) iMazing-opens** — the committed `latest/` tree (the reflink mirror) shared over
  SMB opened natively in iMazing: device info, `Current Backup Encrypted: Yes`, and decrypted photo
  enumeration. **That also retires the last unverified leg of qn.4a's gate 15 ((bw)).** **CANCEL**
  passed too: `cancelled`, child reaped, stub cleaned, honest discard note naming the fallback
  version, no phantom, slot released. **Storage held throughout:** verify+commit of 33 GB took
  **36 s** (A1 is structural, the commit is a snapshot + block clone — neither scales with the
  tree); `bclonesaved` **46.5 → 80.1 GiB** across two consecutive commits, i.e. `latest/` genuinely
  reflinked, never copied; version rotation exact (one `is_latest` per device, always).
  **NOT TICKED — (d) mid-backup Wi-Fi disconnect: landed SAFELY but MISLABELLED.** Everything
  protective held (work discarded, `latest/` untouched, no phantom), but the job ended
  `failed`/`backup_failed` rather than `connection_lost`/`device_disconnected`, because taking the
  device off the LAN produced an immediate receive error (`Could not receive from mobilebackup2
  (-256)`, terminal in 2.5 min, `liveness: active` throughout) instead of a stall — the sampler
  never participated. **Interface fact 2 is INCOMPLETE, not wrong:** a Wi-Fi loss has two shapes
  (the lab's frozen `Heartbeat(SleepyTime)` stall, which quince handles correctly, and this clean
  error exit, which it mislabels). Filed with a fixture-first fix direction. **DECLARED UNRUNNABLE
  — (f)'s unencrypted half:** finding (i)-A needs a device that has NEVER had a backup password (no
  `WillEncrypt` key at all); both lab devices have had one, so disabling encryption yields a
  *present* `false` — the branch that already worked — while changing the Operator's real device
  state and producing a permanently-incomplete version. Declared CI-covered only (story 7 +
  `enc_never_set`), accepted debt with a stated reason; a factory-fresh device belongs to qn.6's
  onboarding gate anyway. **Live progress: PARTIAL** — the WS path updates card and details with no
  reload (confirmed repeatedly), but the percentage moves in jumps and the byte pair beside it is
  wrong, so the leg is recorded honestly rather than ticked clean. **SEVEN findings filed, all
  diagnosed, none blocking:** the gate-blocking target-filesystem bug (fixed in-session, (cd)); a
  Wi-Fi drop mislabelled `failed`; the dashboard card staying silent when the newest attempt failed
  (the most daily-driver-relevant UI gap — `last_backup` semantics are right, the card needs a
  companion affordance); 12 KB progress blobs that mangle the log pane AND make the parser read the
  oldest frame (measured: UI showed `1.6 KB / 2.9 GB` while the tool was at `2.5 GB/2.7 GB` of a
  different file); current-file bytes presented as overall; every version reading `incremental`
  because the device writes `IsFullBackup: false` even for a first 33 GB backup; two `latest` badges
  until reload (client-side staleness, server verified correct); crash-orphaned target stubs unswept.
  **Operational note for the deployment:** the host's `zfs-auto-snap` is snapshotting quince's
  datasets (mid-backup snapshots pinned 15.7 → 67.6 GB), which contradicts stack decision (b)
  ("quince relies only on snapshots it creates") and sits outside quince's retention model — the
  Operator will exclude the parent dataset. **M3's daily-driver goal is met:** both transports
  UI-driven, live updates without a refresh, real last-backup lines, and the major bugs fixed.
- 2026-07-22: (cf) **iMazing-opens PASSED — qn.4a's gate 15 is now FULLY hardware-proven.** The
  Operator opened a quince-committed backup in iMazing (Windows) and it parsed **completely**, not
  merely "opened": device info (`Current Backup Encrypted: Yes`, iPadOS 26.5.2, 2.93 GB, snapshot
  count 1) read from the `…\latest` mirror, the **19-app inventory** enumerated, and the **full
  23-domain File System tree** browsable (`CameraRollDomain`, `HomeDomain`, `KeychainDomain`,
  `MediaDomain`, …). The reference tool declaring a quince **encrypted** commit wholly intelligible
  is the strongest external validation the storage + engine path can get — it exercises qn.5's
  `latest/` mirror, the journaled commit, and A1's encrypted structure end-to-end from outside our
  own code. **qn.4a is now complete on every leg** (engine (bs) + zfs (bw) + iMazing (cf)).
  **Parity observation from the same screenshots (Operator):** iMazing also surfaces *Apps*, *File
  System*, *Profiles* and *Voice Memos*. Triaged — nothing is missing from the **product**: the
  **app list** is already planned in **qn.9**'s overview ("device summary, app list, sizes"), and
  **File System** browsing is **qn.8**'s vault (unlock → browse → download). *Profiles* (MDM/config
  profiles) is niche for a personal backup browser — not planned, no demand. **Voice Memos**,
  however, is a genuine gap in the *parser's* domain parity review (user-created audio + a
  recordings DB — unlike voicemail the Operator certainly has data, and unlike whatsapp it is not
  app-encrypted); recorded in the ios-backup-parser backlog without reopening its settled scope.
- 2026-07-22: (cg) **`PROPOSED (gap)`: the `latest` swap is NOT atomic — the D5a offsite promise is
  broken today. `qn.5b` inserted (Operator-found).** The Operator re-derived the requirement from
  first principles — *a `zfs snapshot` at ANY instant captures a solid `latest/`; the directory
  `idevicebackup2` writes into is rclone-excluded; changes to `latest/` are ATOMIC* — and asked the
  architect to check it rather than accept the prose. **Constraint 3 fails.** Both paths do
  `mv latest → latest.old; mv latest.new → latest` — the in-container Go path
  (`storage/zfs.go:203`) and the host-side hook `mirror` verb (`deploy/storage.md`) — **each
  commented "atomic swap," neither atomic.** Between the renames `latest/` **does not exist**, so
  (1) an `rclone sync` crossing the window sees it missing and **DELETES the remote B2 copy** (sync
  mirrors deletions — a wipe + 33 GB re-upload, not the "briefly mixes two valid versions" stack D5
  claimed), and (2) a `zfs snapshot` there captures a version with no `latest/`. Canon had *named*
  the window but **understated it**, and the fix it already gestured at (exchange-rename) was never
  built. **Architect correction owed:** the earlier claim that `working/` must persist "for
  incrementals" was **wrong** — MobileBackup2 increments from a reflink clone of `latest/` exactly
  as from a persistent directory; the "Seed is a no-op" elegance predates knowing block cloning was
  cheap, which gate 11 has since measured (`bclonesaved` +33.6 GiB). **So the Operator's proposal is
  adopted:** per-job `working/`, seeded as a clone at job start, so between backups the dataset holds
  **only `latest/`** and every snapshot structurally contains exactly one complete backup — the
  requirement satisfied by construction instead of by careful sequencing. **Preserved: resume** —
  on FAILURE the dirty `working/` is KEPT so a retry resumes (a 33 GB Wi-Fi backup dying at 90% must
  not restart); on success it *becomes* `latest/`. **Also folded in (Operator):** the
  `<target>/<UDID>` **symlink dance is dropped** — it exists only because `idevicebackup2` writes to
  `<target>/<UDID>/`, and it *caused* the gate-blocking free-space bug (28b97de) by putting the stub
  on the wrong filesystem; choosing the staging path so the tool's own convention lands correctly
  makes that bug class structurally impossible. **Post-failure UX** (Retry / Reset / possibly
  Retry-clean) is **delegated to the qn.5b implementer** — 2-vs-3 actions, landed as a **contract
  proposal reviewed here** (`Reset` is the landed `RepairWorkingCopy`, CLI-only today, so a UI
  surface is a REST addition). **Interface fact to verify live, never assumed: does ZFS implement
  `RENAME_EXCHANGE`** (a VFS flag); the symlink workaround stays forbidden (D5a). Privilege split
  favours us — only FICLONE needs the host, so the hook keeps the reflink and quince does the
  exchange in-container. Commit reorders to verify → exchange → snapshot, making the version
  `latest/` and `browse_root` point at the real latest backup. Bonus: D5's **two version models
  collapse toward one** (namespace backends already seed-from-latest and rotate).
  **Alternative considered + REJECTED (same day, recorded in the qn.5b roadmap entry so the
  implementer doesn't re-explore it):** an all-ZFS-primitives design — `zfs clone` the working
  area into its own dataset, back it up there, then `zfs send workdir@ready | zfs receive -F
  …/latest`. The clone half is genuinely clever (instant, zero-space, and it would sidestep the
  FICLONE-`EPERM` problem entirely, being a `zfs` command rather than a syscall) but loses on
  three counts: the seed is already cheap and measured, a clone **pins its origin snapshot**
  (retention entanglement), and making `working` a *dataset* is exactly what forces the fatal
  half. The `send | receive -F` publish step is a **full 33 GB copy** (no block sharing) and,
  because the destination is rolled back and applied progressively (typically unmounted for the
  operation), it turns a **microsecond** missing-`latest/` window into a **minutes-long** one —
  strictly worse than the bug being fixed. **Generalizable principle recorded:** the requirement
  is that a *filesystem path stay continuously valid for a walker*, and every dataset-level
  operation (send/receive/rename/promote) involves a **mount transition**, so none can satisfy
  it — only a directory-level atomic exchange can. send/receive remains exactly right for what
  it already does here: **replication** (syncoid offsite, proven at gate 11).
- 2026-07-22: (ch) **`qn.6a` inserted before the freeze — soak-ready UI. Sequence: qn.5b → qn.6a →
  freeze + revamp (app soaking).** The Operator broadened the goal from "usable for me" toward "a
  first alpha tester," and — decisively — gave the reason: **they want the app in real-world use on
  staging *while the process revamp runs*.** The architect had argued for freeze-first and
  **conceded**: that argument assumed the revamp and the soak compete for time, and they don't. The
  revamp is *process* work, so the codebase is idle throughout; a usable app converts that idle
  stretch into **soak time, which cannot be compressed or backfilled**. And **mobile is the
  precondition, not polish** — if you must be at a desktop, the daily use (hence the soak) never
  happens at all. **Three architect challenges, all accepted:** (1) **don't conflate "my soak" with
  "ready for a friend"** — the soak justifies mobile + offline devices + labels; it does NOT justify
  the DSM feasibility spike, storage onboarding, or gate **12c** (which un-defers the moment a
  non-zfs tester appears, since a Synology lands on btrfs/ext4 → reflink or the **currently
  disabled-to-copy hardlink tier**). Those wait for after the revamp. (2) **5b runs first** — it
  changes the `working/` lifecycle and Retry semantics, i.e. precisely the behaviour a soak
  observes; soaking on a model about to change wastes the findings. (3) **"offline devices" needs
  its shape pinned or it silently becomes the biggest item** — minimal form is a union of live muxd
  presence with UDIDs already in the versions registry, plus persisting the identity already
  fetched at enrichment, not a new subsystem. **Operator-specified offline-card behaviour:** same
  card shape with a **disabled "Back up now"** so layout stays aligned with online cards — the
  architect added the one constraint that it be **disabled *with a reason***, never a dead button
  (the qn.4b pattern and the (bq) lesson). **Forward note recorded, explicitly NOT scope:** a
  post-qn.12 **"Wake up"** spike — an offline device may just be *asleep on the same LAN*, and a Web
  Push to its PWA might rouse it so mDNS resumes and netmuxd rediscovers it. Fits the assisted model
  (quince cannot back up unattended but may *nudge*) and needs no new infrastructure beyond a push
  kind, but it is unproven that waking the screen restores Wi-Fi-sync visibility and it can only
  work on the same network — so it stays a spike with honest UI ("wake attempt sent"), never a
  success claim. **qn.6a is the LAST rung under the current process:** its implementer records
  process friction as it goes (letter collisions, doc drift, gate-ownership seams, spec overhead)
  and hands it to the revamp as evidence, so the process isn't redesigned from memory.
- 2026-07-22: (ci) **gate-11 findings — DURABLE disposition + rung distribution (bookkeeping).**
  The seven gate-11 findings were narrated in (ce) and filed as UI task chips, but **task chips do
  not survive an app restart** — so this entry is their durable home, each with a named owner, so
  none is orphaned (the no-orphan-finding discipline). The Operator's qn.5b/qn.6a insertion already
  absorbed several; this records the full map and flags the two that need an architect/Operator
  ruling rather than deciding them here.
  | # | Finding | Owner | Why |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | target stub on the cache filesystem → device refuses large backups | **FIXED** `28b97de` ((cd)) | gate-blocking; fixed in-session, fixture-first |
  | 2 | 409 "already running" on instant Retry (terminal-before-slot-release) | **qn.7** ((cc)) | state-honesty, narrow window; pull-forward trigger if it bites |
  | 3 | 12 KB progress-bar blobs mangle the log pane AND make the parser read the *oldest* frame (stale bytes) | **qn.6a** ((ch) row) | one `SplitFunc` clears pane + stale byte counter + log bloat; on the soak path |
  | 4 | crash-orphaned `/cache` target stubs unswept by reconciliation | **SUBSUMED by qn.5b** ((cg)) | qn.5b drops the `<target>/<UDID>` symlink dance entirely → the stub class ceases to exist; nothing to sweep. **Chip dismissed as superseded.** |
  | 5 | "Backup directory is /cache/…" job-log line reads as alarming | **SUBSUMED by qn.5b** ((cg)), residual clarity nit → **qn.6a** log work | no more `/cache` target: the path the tool reports becomes the real staging dir. Only the wording nit (if any) remains, and folds into qn.6a's log pass |
  | 6 | dashboard card stays silent when the newest attempt FAILED (shows only last *success*) | **qn.6a** *(PROPOSED — confirm)* | `last_backup` semantics are correct ((bz)); the card needs a "needs attention + Retry" companion line. Most daily-driver-relevant UI gap — a soak tester who can't see failures defeats the soak, so it fits qn.6a's soak-usability charter |
  | 7 | two "latest" badges until reload (client keeps the demoted version's flag) | **qn.6a** *(PROPOSED — timing)* | cheap client-side fix (mirror the server's single-latest invariant in the versions store). **But qn.5b reorders commit + reshapes the `version.*`/`latest` surface** — confirm whether the fix rides qn.5b (where that surface changes) or qn.6a (pure UI) |
  | 8 | a Wi-Fi drop mid-transfer lands `failed`, not `connection_lost` (interface fact 2 incomplete — a drop has TWO shapes: stall vs clean receive-error exit) | **qn.7** *(PROPOSED)* | it IS a Wi-Fi transport-loss classification + interface-fact-2 correction, squarely qn.7's chaos-suite/liveness domain; the parser now captures the tool's reason, so the classification hook already exists. Fixture-first (`wifi-dropoff-receive-error`) beside the existing stall fixture |
  | 9 | every version reads `incremental` — device writes `IsFullBackup:false` even for a first 33 GB backup | **NEEDS A RULING** (ties to open product question (bs)) | two halves: (a) derive `kind` honestly (`BackupState=="new"` / no prior version → `full`) — a small storage/`verify.go` fix; (b) whether to pass `idevicebackup2 --full` on a first backup / after an encryption change — a **product decision** ((bs)). (a) makes qn.5's full-only shard check actually run. Architect to assign a rung; not decided here |
  | 10 | progress percent freezes then jumps (driven only by sparse "NN% Finished") + current-file bytes shown as the *backup* total | **SPLIT: qn.6a** (byte labelling, rides #3's `SplitFunc`) **+ qn.7** (percent/liveness shaping) *(PROPOSED)* | the honest-byte relabel is soak-path UI; smoother percent-from-cumulative-bytes + the liveness note firing during active large-file receives is progress/liveness *shaping* = qn.7 |
  Net: **#1 fixed, #2/#8 → qn.7, #3/#5/#6/#7 → qn.6a, #4 obsolete (qn.5b), #9 unassigned pending a ruling, #10 split.** The four PROPOSED rows and #9 want an architect glance; the rest are settled. P1/P1b (the muxer-runs-but-blind onboarding/health warnings) remain qn.6 in the proposals ledger — distinct from these, not re-homed.
- 2026-07-22: (cj) **architect rulings on (ci)'s four PROPOSED rows + #9 (the audit itself: approved,
  and the #4/#5 "a redesign deletes the bug" subsumption is the model catch).** **#6 (failed newest
  attempt is invisible — card shows only last *success*) → qn.6a, and UPGRADED to CORE, not
  optional.** This is the direct consequence of the (bz) decision to make `last_backup` mean last
  *success*: correct, but it *created* the duty to surface a failed newest attempt elsewhere or
  failures go invisible — and **a soak whose failures are invisible is a worthless soak**, so it is
  load-bearing for qn.6a's charter. Shape: a "needs attention · Retry" companion line, not a
  mutation of `last_backup`. **#7 (two `latest` badges until reload) → qn.6a** (client-store fix:
  mirror the server's single-`is_latest`-per-device invariant when applying `version.*` events —
  pure UI). **qn.5b re-confirms the SERVER invariant still holds after its commit reorder**, but
  the client fix is UI and stays out of the storage rung. **#8 (Wi-Fi drop → `failed` not
  `connection_lost`) → qn.7 CONFIRMED** — it is transport-loss *classification* + the interface-fact-2
  correction (a drop has two shapes: the stall quince handles, and the clean receive-error exit it
  mislabels), squarely qn.7's chaos-suite/liveness domain, fixture-first beside the stall fixture.
  **Soak guard:** qn.6a's UI pass must present whatever terminal state honestly so a *bare* "failed"
  doesn't read as data loss during the soak — the outcome was SAFE (work discarded, `latest/`
  untouched); the label is what's wrong. **#10 SPLIT CONFIRMED** — honest byte-labelling (current-file
  bytes shown as the *backup* total is a lie) → qn.6a, riding #3's `SplitFunc`; percent-from-cumulative
  smoothing + the liveness note firing during a large-file receive → qn.7 (progress/liveness shaping).
  **#9 RULED (the substantive one): SPLIT.** **(a) honest `kind` (full vs incremental) → qn.5b** —
  don't heuristic it in `verify.go` off the unreliable `IsFullBackup` flag; under qn.5b's per-job
  `working/` model quince *authoritatively knows* full-vs-incremental, because it IS whether `working/`
  was seeded from an existing `latest/` (incremental) or started with none (a first/full backup). The
  honest signal falls out of the seed decision qn.5b already makes — more correct AND cheaper than a
  Status.plist heuristic; a genuine tightening, not scope creep. **(b) force `--full` after an
  encryption change → qn.7 (correctness/hardening), with a SOAK CAVEAT recorded now:** an incremental
  built on a prior version encrypted under a *different* keybag can be inconsistent, so during the soak
  either avoid changing the backup password, or **Reset** (the landed `RepairWorkingCopy`, surfaced by
  qn.5b) after an encryption change to force the next backup full. qn.7 automates the force; the interim
  mitigation already exists. That (b) is real correctness, not cosmetics, is why it is flagged rather
  than parked silently.
- 2026-07-22: (ck) **#9(a) REFRAMED by an Operator challenge ("does the `incremental` label bring
  any user value?") — it doesn't, and it mildly MISLEADS: drop it from the UI, keep it internal.**
  The `full`/`incremental` label describes the *transfer* (idevicebackup2 sent deltas), not the
  *result* — and **every quince version is a complete, independently-restorable backup** (a zfs
  snapshot is the whole tree; a namespace version is a complete dir). So "incremental" imports the
  fragile-chain mental model from Time Machine/Borg/restic/Veeam — "delete the full and it breaks"
  — which is FALSE here and undercuts D5's central guarantee that versions are independent, never a
  chain. Verified: displayed at `VersionList.tsx:24`, a frozen `Version.kind` (§2), and internally
  it gates the encrypted-verify shard check (assert "all 256 shards present" only on a full
  transfer, where absence is definitely a bug — on a small incremental it could false-fail). So it
  has real INTERNAL value and near-zero USER value. **Ruling:** (1) **qn.6a drops `kind` from the
  version card** — show what the user acts on instead: date, size, the **delta size** ("added 1.2
  GB" is genuinely useful, unlike "incremental"), encrypted, verified. (2) **`kind` stays internal +
  in the contract** (non-breaking; CLI/power-user/debug), derived honestly per #9(a)'s qn.5b home —
  which the verify shard-check still needs (a first backup mislabeled `incremental` today means the
  full-only check silently never runs, so a broken first backup could pass). The Operator's
  challenge thus flipped the user-facing half of #9(a) from "make the label accurate" to "stop
  showing a label that misleads," while preserving the internal-honesty half for verification
  correctness.
- 2026-07-22: (cl) **Post-freeze EPIC captured: storage as a first-class entity (multi-storage).**
  Operator direction, recorded so it lives in the docs not just their head; full write-up in the
  roadmap ("Post-freeze EPIC — Storage as a first-class entity"). **The core insight is correct and
  names a real modeling error:** a backend (`zfs`/`reflink`/…) is a property of a **storage**, not a
  backup — and today's per-version `Version.backend` (contracts §2) is the *symptom*. Target: storage
  as a first-class UI entity (created in onboarding Plex-style, on the dashboard with space/count
  stats), one immutable backend per storage selected at creation, a device backing up to multiple
  storages, **incremental scoped to (device, storage)** (so `latest/`/`working/` becomes per-storage
  and the first backup to a NEW storage is always full), and offline storages shown-not-errored.
  **Architect endorsed the direction and challenged six points** (all in the roadmap): storage
  identity must be a UUID written *into* the storage (not path-based, for the removable/offline case);
  the "pre-backup probe" reframed as a reachability/sanity health-check while backend *selection*
  stays at creation; **offsite/B2 is probably a REPLICATION of a storage, not a storage** (open fork);
  the iMazing case splits into **external-readonly** (browse foreign backups in place — a natural fit
  for the sibling libraries, which read *any* backup) vs **import/migration** (copy in); offline
  storage does NOT queue unattended backups (fights D13); and a storage `mode` (`managed` |
  `external-readonly`). **Near-term:** qn.5b's mechanics are storage-agnostic (only the path prefix
  changes), so it is safe to build now provided it doesn't hard-bake single-storage assumptions —
  paths storage-scopeable, `last_backup` derivation tolerant of going per-storage. **Not a rung — an
  epic, scoped into rungs post-freeze under the revamped process** (exactly the large, contract-
  touching, multi-surface work the revamp should improve).
- 2026-07-22: (cm) **Later idea banked: scoped per-device view + QR/link device enrollment.** Full
  note in the roadmap Later/parked. An admin issues a **scoped token** (view/backup/restore-later) so
  the *device owner* (not the admin) runs their own backups and browses their own data; onboarding via
  a link/QR from the admin's device page that auto-authorizes the opening device. **Well-motivated,
  not just convenience:** it is the delegated-access dimension qn.12's phone-first assisted model
  assumes away (admin ≠ phone owner in a household) → natural home is after/with qn.12. **Security
  notes banked now so a naive later build doesn't get it wrong:** the link carries a **one-time
  short-TTL enrollment secret that mints a device-bound session, NOT a bearer token in the URL**;
  **restore is a dangerous scope** (admin-only or re-auth even here); it is a real **auth subsystem**
  (capability tokens, per-device sessions, enrollment, revocation UI, audit) that reopens the qn.1
  security baseline. Later, not soon.
- 2026-07-22: (cn) **Spike banked: enable/disable Wi-Fi discoverability ("Wi-Fi sync") from inside
  quince** (Operator-raised; full note on the qn.7 roadmap entry). **Why it's bigger than it looks:**
  Wi-Fi is the PRIMARY transport (ruling (h)), but enabling Wi-Fi sync currently requires
  **Finder/iTunes** ("Show this device when on Wi-Fi") — so today's self-contained onboarding (D12
  "everything in quince") is **broken for the primary transport**: a fresh user pairs over USB in
  quince, then must reach for a Mac to turn Wi-Fi backups on. **Likely mechanism — to VERIFY, not
  assume (interface-facts rule):** a lockdown `SetValue` on `com.apple.mobile.wireless_lockdown`
  (`EnableWifiConnections`-ish), which libimobiledevice's `lockdownd_set_value` supports; it is a
  USB-trusted op, and since pairing is USB-only anyway (D2) the natural moment is *during the qn.3
  USB pair* — plug → Trust → pair **and** enable Wi-Fi sync → unplug → Wi-Fi works. Read-back yields a
  `wifi_sync: on|off|unknown` device property to show + toggle beside pairing/encryption. Spike
  answers: exact key, whether SetValue takes effect (reboot/respring?), USB-required, unlock/Trust
  needed. Home: qn.7 (Wi-Fi) or a small device-ops add folded into qn.6 onboarding; if infeasible,
  onboarding documents the Finder step honestly. Post-freeze.
- 2026-07-22: (co) **qn.5b spec APPROVED with amendments — two Operator-caught issues + the seven
  gate forks ruled.** The spec is strong (it found a THIRD non-atomic window — namespace
  `finishRotation`, missed by (cg) — and the non-idempotent-exchange marker guard is exactly the
  right first-class treatment). **Amendment A — "reflink seed" is loose prose hiding a real hazard
  (Operator-caught).** The seed-split *table* is correct (`clonetree.Clone` picks per-backend
  strategy, so hardlink seeds by hardlink) but the NARRATIVE (goal line 7, §unified-model line 169,
  decision 1) says "seeded as a reflink clone" universally. That is not just wording: **seeding the
  hardlink backend means `working/<udid>` shares inodes with `latest/`, so an in-place write by
  `idevicebackup2` corrupts the committed `latest/` through the alias — the exact class the deferred
  12c matrix governs.** The spec even says "must not rely on hardlink correctness it doesn't prove"
  (line 111) while doing precisely that. **Ruling:** the seed clone must use the SAME
  hardlink-safety discipline as qn.5's version promotion — i.e. the hardlink tier stays
  **disabled-to-copy** for the *seed* too until 12c proves it (a hardlink seed is only safe if every
  file `idevicebackup2` may mutate in place is copied-not-linked, which is 12c's whole matrix). So
  on the hardlink backend, **seed = copy (surfaced), not hardlink**, until 12c. reflink (independent
  clones) and copy are safe; hardlink is not, and the prose must say "clone via the backend's safe
  strategy," never "reflink," everywhere. Fix the narrative + gate the hardlink-seed path.
  **Amendment B — keep the ULID in the snapshot name; do NOT drop it (Operator floated dropping it).**
  The ULID *is* `versionID` (the marker/journal/`Version.id`/`browse_root` key) — embedding it is
  what maps a `zfs list` line back to its version/logs; and two same-minute backups (failed→retry, or
  rapid gate testing — the Operator's own `zfs list` shows three same-day snapshots) would collide on
  a date-only name and **fail `zfs snapshot`**. ULIDs are lexically time-sortable, so
  `quince-<date>-<ULID>` already sorts chronologically AND stays collision-free. If time-of-day
  readability is wanted, **widen the date to `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM`** and keep the ULID tail — never drop
  it. **Gate forks (§"decisions for the architect") ruled:** (1) full per-job model — YES; (2)
  exchange in-container with a host-hook fallback gated on the in-container `exch` probe — YES; (3)
  `mirror`→`seed` hook verb, deployed helper updated — YES (real one-time deploy cost, ship the
  migration note); (4) pre-qn.5b snapshots treated as disposable lab data, `Scan` skips gracefully —
  YES (pre-v0.1, throwaway; the perf-budget reasoning is sound); (5) 2-action Retry/Reset — YES; (6)
  `storage.zfs.mirror`→`seed` config rename — YES (no alias, pre-freeze single-user); (7) unify
  `Discard` to keep-dirty-working on all backends incl. cancel — YES (the namespace-deletes-work
  asymmetry is the (cj) #4/#5 bug). **The Reset contract proposal** (`POST /api/devices/{udid}/
  reset-working` → 202|404|409) is **accepted** — clean, audited, never touches committed state; land
  it in contracts §1 during build (the qn.2b/qn.3 pattern). Build on the ruling.
- 2026-07-24: (cp) **qn.5b BUILT (CI-proven) — atomic `latest` + the `working/` lifecycle redesign
  landed per the (co) ruling + both amendments.** `make gates` (go + vault + ui) + `make image` green
  in `quince-dev`; coverage backup **85.2%** / storage **78.9%** / httpapi **73.2%** / demo 54.9% /
  cmd 20.7%. **What landed:** (1) an `exchange(a,b)` primitive over `unix.Renameat2(…, RENAME_EXCHANGE)`
  (`exchange_linux.go` + a `!linux` stub for macOS tooling) — and its **primitive test doubles as the
  in-CI proof that the test filesystem supports RENAME_EXCHANGE** (the "test the layer you run in"
  lesson; it passes on the container tmpfs). (2) A **unified per-job lifecycle** across all four
  backends: `WorkDir` returns the idevicebackup2 TARGET (the `working/` parent) after seeding
  `working/<udid>` from `latest/` (**safe strategy — hardlink→copy, amendment A**) or RESUMING a dirty
  one; commit does verify → **atomic exchange** working/<udid> ⇄ latest/ → snapshot (zfs) / archive to
  `versions/<prev>` (namespace); `Discard` KEEPS the dirty working on every terminal (unified — the
  (cj) #4/#5 namespace-deletes-work asymmetry is gone); `RepairWorkingCopy` is now **Reset** (discard).
  (3) The **`<target>/<UDID>` symlink dance is deleted** (`supervisor.go` lost `prepareTarget`) — the
  target is the storage `working/` parent, always on the storage fs, so **bug 28b97de is structurally
  impossible**; the free-space regression test was rewritten to assert that. (4) **browse_root** moves
  `…/working` → `…/latest`; **snapshot name** `quince-<YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM>-<ULID>` (amendment B — ULID
  kept, minute-widened; `snapDateLayout`). (5) **Honest internal `kind`** from a `.quince-work.json`
  seed sentinel (`Verify(tree, kind)` no longer trusts `IsFullBackup`) — a first backup is now
  authoritatively `full`, so the encrypted blob-shard check actually runs (finding #9(a)); a stale
  engine assertion that expected `incremental` for a first Wi-Fi backup was flipped to `full` (the fix
  working). (6) **Reset**: `POST /api/devices/{udid}/reset-working` → 202|404|409|503 (engine-owned for
  single-flight) + `quince device reset-working` CLI + contracts §1. (7) Hook **`mirror`→`seed` verb**
  (host-side reflink clone latest→working/<udid> + chown; migration note in `deploy/storage.md`);
  config **`storage.zfs.mirror`→`seed`** (enum auto|reflink|copy — hardlink dropped); `MirrorReport`→
  `SeedReport`; offsite filter drops the obsolete `work/**` rule. **Gate proof:** the two independent
  observers are a CI concurrent-reader test (`latest/` marker is NEVER missing/torn across a running
  commit, both models — the exact failure the two-rename swap caused) + the marker-guarded kill-matrix
  (prepared/exchanged/archived|snapshot_created) + resume-without-re-transfer. **Docs are part of the
  diff:** stack D5/D5a (the `PROPOSED (gap)` flipped to RESOLVED; the commit-mirror block marked
  SUPERSEDED), design §4/§5 (layout, interface, commit phases, escape hatch), contracts §1/§2/§6, and
  `deploy/storage.md` all updated; the demo fixtures show the new model. **Owed to a hardware day
  (named, not silently deferred):** the real-rpool lab legs — **G-snapshot** (probe-snapshot loop
  during a running backup + at commit → always a complete `latest/`), **G-rclone** (continuous sync
  never deletes/tears the remote), **G-exchange-live** (the in-container `exch` probe on the deployed
  dataset — the go/no-go for the in-container exchange) — plus a syncoid mid-write pass, preserved
  verbatim in the qn.5b spec's Gates + the `//go:build lab` harness. **12c stays deferred** (hardlink
  disabled-to-copy, now including the seed). Frontier → **qn.6a**.
- 2026-07-24: (cq) **qn.5b post-build architect review: APPROVED + LANDED on main (`fc45ae7`,
  ff-only, pushed).** Verified in code, not the report: **both (co) amendments** (the seed ladder is
  reflink→copy-NEVER-hardlink with a surfaced warn — `seedreport.go` states the aliasing hazard;
  `snapNameFor` emits `quince-<YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM>-<ULID>`); the **exchange primitive** is the named
  `unix.Renameat2(..., unix.RENAME_EXCHANGE)` symbols with the same-filesystem constraint documented
  at the definition; the **marker guard** for the non-idempotent exchange is present on both models;
  the **two-observer CI proof** exists (`atomic_test.go`: a concurrent reader loops on `latest/`'s
  marker across a full commit — always v1 or v2, never missing — the exact assertion the old
  two-rename swap fails); canon flipped (the stack `PROPOSED (gap)` → RESOLVED; contracts carry
  Reset + the new snapshot example); letters unique ((cp) build entry); whole-branch privacy sweep
  clean. The build's honest flags stand as recorded: **owed to a hardware day** — G-snapshot +
  G-rclone + **G-exchange-live** (the in-container `exch` probe on the deployed dataset = the
  go/no-go for keeping the exchange in-container; fallback = a hook `exchange` verb) + a syncoid
  mid-write regression, all on the real rpool with the **updated `seed`-verb helper deployed first**
  (the one real operational step). **Operator to-dos for that day:** re-install `quince-zfs-helper`
  from `deploy/storage.md` (the `mirror` verb is gone), and `zfs destroy` the pre-qn.5b test
  snapshots (their content sits at `…/working`; the new reader correctly reports them `missing` —
  decision 4's disposable-lab-data ruling, not a bug). qn.5b's hardware legs can ride the same
  session as qn.6a's soak start.
- 2026-07-24: (cr) **FINDING (Operator-caught on the staging UI, 2026-07-24): versions whose artifact
  is GONE are still listed as normal backups — `missing` is tracked everywhere except the one place
  the user looks.** Surfaced by the qn.5b snapshot migration: after destroying the pre-qn.5b
  snapshots, startup reconciliation correctly marked their 6 rows `missing` ("kept, not dropped" —
  roll-forward), yet the Devices page still renders them in *Recent backups* with full size +
  `structure verified`, visually identical to live versions. **Verified in code, and the mechanism is
  narrow: `store.VersionRow.Missing` exists and is honoured by `LastBackup` (skips), `recomputeLatest`
  (skips), `Delete` (skips the artifact op) and `VerifyVersion` (reports honestly) — but
  `wire.Version` has NO `missing` field at all (contracts §2), and `Manager.Versions()` maps every row
  through `toWire` unfiltered/unflagged.** So the drift is detected and recorded faithfully; it simply
  never crosses the wire. That is a **state-honesty violation** (hard rule: the UI never claims more
  than is proven) — quince currently asserts backups that do not exist, with sizes, and offers
  `Unlock` on them.
  **Operator's framing, and the refinement:** the Operator noted this is the DB-vs-disk mismatch they
  flagged from the start, having originally proposed "no DB, the data IS the source of truth."
  Recorded honestly: canon *did* adopt disk-as-source-of-truth (stack D3 / design §5 — "on startup
  the disk is the source of truth", first-class reconciliation, identity carried in on-disk
  `quince-version.json` markers); the DB is an INDEX over that, and it exists because the version-list
  read has a <100 ms perf budget a per-request fs/snapshot walk cannot meet. The index did its job
  here. So this is **not** the model being wrong — it is the *last mile* missing. Two distinct
  defects fall out, and they want different fixes:
  **(a) `missing` is invisible (the screenshot).** Fix = surface it: add `missing` to `wire.Version`
  (contracts §2 addition — needs an architect ruling) and have the UI either omit such versions or
  render them explicitly dead (no size claim, no `Unlock`, an actionable "artifact gone — remove?").
  Deleting the row already works for missing artifacts (`DELETE /api/versions/{id}`). **Proposed owner:
  qn.6a** — same family as its CORE finding #6 (invisible failures make a soak worthless, (cj)): a
  soak that displays phantom backups is equally worthless.
  **(b) reconciliation is STARTUP-ONLY** — the Operator's "regular sync job." An artifact vanishing
  while quince runs (exactly this case: snapshots destroyed under a live daemon) goes unnoticed until
  restart; here the redeploy masked it. Fix candidates: a periodic reconcile, or cheap
  revalidation-on-read for the listed set. **Deliberately NOT auto-assigned** — it interacts with the
  multi-storage epic (cl), where a storage can be legitimately OFFLINE (removable HDD unplugged):
  marking its versions `missing` would be exactly the wrong answer, so "unreachable" and "gone" must
  become distinguishable *before* a background sweep is allowed to mark anything. Architect to route;
  do not build a sweep that cannot tell those two apart.
- 2026-07-24: (cs) **HARDWARE FINDING + FIX (branch `claude/qn5b-seed-timeout-fix`): the 60 s ZFS
  metadata timeout was applied to the qn.5b `seed`, which is O(file count) — it SIGKILLed the real
  34 GB iPhone seed mid-clone and made the primary device un-backup-able.** First real qn.5b iPhone
  backup on the lab box failed at *exactly* 60 s with `seed work area: … zfs seed …: signal: killed`.
  Root cause: `zfsOpTimeout = 60s` was written for the metadata verbs (`snapshot`/`create`/`list`/
  `destroy`, all O(1)) and qn.5b reused it to bound the `seed` verb — which reflink-clones an ENTIRE
  backup tree. **Measured on the real pool:** an iOS backup is ~133 k files (256 blob shards); reflink
  is **per-FILE**, so cost is O(file count), NOT O(bytes) — ~7 600 files/s → 34 GB/133 k-file seed =
  **17.5 s clone alone, ~32 s warm / >60 s cold**; the 3 GB/94 k-file iPad seed = 5.3 s (which is why
  the iPad sailed through and the iPhone died). Reflink buys SPACE, not syscalls. **Fix (this branch,
  gates-green):** a distinct `zfsSeedTimeout = 30 min` (generous backstop only — the JOB context
  already cancels, the liveness sampler owns stall detection) via a new `seedCtx()`, leaving the 60 s
  bound for the metadata verbs; regression test `TestSeedUsesItsOwnGenerousTimeout` inspects the
  deadline the hook verb actually receives and fails if it is ≤ the metadata timeout (discriminates:
  the old code gives *exactly* 60 s). **Also (2):** dropped a redundant `chown -R` from the hook
  `seed` verb — `cp -a` already preserves `latest/`'s (container-uid) ownership, so only the mkdir'd
  parent needs chowning; re-timed on hardware **70 s → 22.9 s**, no file left mis-owned. `deploy/
  storage.md` carries the sizing note (budget minutes for large devices). Extends memory
  [[zfs-reflink-clone-facts]] (mirror→seed; seed timing). Precedent for an in-session hardware fix:
  the qn.4a free-space bug (cd).
- 2026-07-24: (ct) **qn.5b HARDWARE-VALIDATED end-to-end on the real pool + real iPhone/iPad over
  Wi-Fi — every owed lab leg now proven.** Session on the lab box: the deployed hook was upgraded
  (`mirror`→`seed` verb) and the `seed` proven live (verdict `SHARED`, pool `bclonesaved` +3.07 GB on
  the 3 GB iPad tree). Legs: **G-exchange-live PASS** — the in-container `renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE)`
  works in the *deployed* nested-OCI/unprivileged-LXC shape, and a SAME-layer contrast showed FICLONE
  still `EPERM`s there → the (co) privilege split is now proven **empirically** (exchange in-container,
  seed host-side), no host-side fallback verb needed. **G-snapshot PASS** (775 probe-snapshots, 0 with
  a missing/torn `latest/`) — with the honest caveat that a ~0.1 Hz probe loop has little power to
  catch a microsecond window, so this proves real-pool integration, NOT atomicity (the atomicity proof
  stays the exchange primitive + the CI concurrent-reader test). **G-rclone PASS** (continuous sync
  across commits; the remote `latest/` never deleted or torn). **Reset op PASS** (discarded a 34 GB
  orphan cleanly). **keep-dirty-working-on-FAILURE PASS** (a failed backup left a resumable 37 GB
  `working/`, `latest/` untouched, exactly one snapshot — no partial commit). **resume-without-re-seed
  PASS** (`"resuming dirty working (zfs)"`, no re-clone). **iPad 3 GB full cycle PASS** and — after the
  (cs) fix + moving the phone closer to the AP — **iPhone 34 GB full cycle PASS** (version
  01KY970TC…, honest `incremental` kind, clean `latest/`-only baseline). Both devices proven.
  **Wi-Fi failure root-cause dive (owner = qn.7, NOT qn.5b, NOT netmuxd).** Early iPhone attempts
  failed `Could not receive from mobilebackup2 (-4/-256)` / netmuxd `Heartbeat(Timeout)`. A deep
  pcap + `ss -tinoe` + netmuxd-DEBUG dive (tcpdump via `nsenter` into the CT netns; `RUST_LOG=debug`
  via a compose env override — quince honours it, `muxsup` only injects `info` when unset) established:
  **(1)** real Wi-Fi packet loss + link drops (exponential-backoff retransmits into a silent phone);
  **(2)** netmuxd EXONERATED — no backpressure (0 real zero-window), nothing logged even at DEBUG, the
  phone stopped ACKing raw TCP *below* netmuxd; **(3)** NOT a message-size/64 KiB bug (failure timing
  varied). **Honest correction recorded (the implementer over-concluded a root cause TWICE under live
  pressure):** a multi-minute `app_limited` idle window — iOS doing its own local snapshot/file-prep,
  socket legitimately idle — was misread as a "deterministic deadlock at ~264 MB"; the backup actually
  SUCCEEDED. **Durable lesson for qn.7:** iOS Wi-Fi backups have long LEGITIMATE idle pauses, so
  quince's liveness thresholds must not panic on them, and the real fix is qn.7's planned patched
  libimobiledevice timeout (30 s → 15 min, upstream #1413) so a backup rides out BOTH the pause and a
  transient Wi-Fi flap. Two real-world captures preserved as qn.7 chaos-suite fixtures (a genuine
  Wi-Fi failure + a success-with-pause) — **local-only on the lab host; they contain LAN IPs and must
  NEVER enter git** (privacy gate). **Finding B (open, architect to route): a partial/killed seed
  leaves an orphaned `working/` that the next `WorkDir` silently RESUMES into** — because the seed
  sentinel (`.quince-work.json`) is written only AFTER a successful seed. Today it only bit us because
  the (cs) timeout SIGKILLed a seed mid-clone, but any crash mid-seed reproduces it, and the failure
  mode is a version that could pass structural verify while missing blobs. Proposed fix: write the
  sentinel BEFORE seeding with `seed_complete:false`, flip true on success; `WorkDir` refuses to
  resume anything not marked complete (re-seeds). Small, but a state-honesty/correctness fix.
- 2026-07-24: (cu) **DEGRADED UX regression (Operator-caught on hardware): qn.5b made the gap between
  tapping "Back up now" and the on-device passcode prompt MUCH longer — proportional to device size.**
  Cause is structural to qn.5b's per-job `working/`: **pre-qn.5b the zfs `Seed` was a no-op** (a
  persistent `working/` was already in place), so `idevicebackup2` launched within the same second and
  the phone prompted almost immediately. **Now `WorkDir` reflink-clones `latest/` → `working/<udid>`
  synchronously inside preflight, BEFORE `idevicebackup2` starts** — and that seed is ~23 s+ for the
  34 GB iPhone (O(files); (cs)). So the passcode prompt (which is triggered by idevicebackup2's device
  handshake) can't appear until the seed finishes → ~20+ s of dead air where the UI shows nothing
  happening. The *real* complaint is the dead air, not the raw latency. **Mitigation options for the
  architect (roughly cheapest → biggest):** **(1)** surface a distinct **"preparing / seeding" job
  phase** between `preflight` and `backing_up` (quince already models phases) so the UI shows
  "Preparing — cloning from your last backup…" with progress instead of a frozen button; fixes the
  PERCEPTION (the actual gripe) without touching latency — **natural fit for qn.6a's soak-UX charter,
  recommended first.** **(2)** overlap the device handshake with the seed so the passcode prompt fires
  immediately while the seed runs in the background — but idevicebackup2 does handshake+read in one
  process, so this needs either a lightweight pre-handshake or a lazily-seeding tool (more complex,
  transport-adjacent). **(3)** keep a **warm pre-seeded `working/`** between backups (or pre-seed
  proactively right after a commit / on the qn.12 opportunity signal) so "Back up now" finds it ready
  → instant start; cost is it **breaks "between backups the dataset holds only `latest/`"** (snapshot
  bloat — rclone still excludes it), a direct trade-off against qn.5b's clean-snapshot invariant, so
  architect-only and probably a config toggle. **(4)** faster seed — inherently O(files) (~133 k
  reflinks); the (cs) chown fix already trimmed it and there is no big win left short of the REJECTED
  zfs-clone-as-dataset approach ((cg)). **Recommendation: (1) now (cheap, soak-path), (2)/(3) only if
  the raw latency — not just its visibility — must drop.** Sent to architect for routing.
- 2026-07-24: (cv) **ARCHITECT REVIEW of the qn.5b hardware session: branch approved + landed
  (main → `0f9eaff`, ff-only); all four routed findings adjudicated.** Code verified, not just the
  report: the (cs) fix's mechanism (a distinct `zfsSeedTimeout` via `seedCtx()`; the metadata verbs
  keep 60 s), the regression test's discrimination (it inspects the deadline the hook verb actually
  receives and the old code gives *exactly* 60 s), and the hook `chown` reasoning (`cp -a` preserves
  ownership; only the mkdir'd parent needs it). (cr)'s mechanism confirmed in code (`wire.Version`
  has no `missing` field; `toWire` never maps `store.VersionRow.Missing`), as was Finding B's
  (`WorkDir` resumes ANY non-empty `working/<udid>`; `writeWorkState` runs only after the seed).
  Privacy sweep clean (no LAN IPs in the diff; the pcap fixtures stay local-only). **Rulings:**
  **(1) (cr)(a) → qn.6a, CONFIRMED,** with the contract shape ruled: add `missing: bool` to
  `wire.Version` (contracts §2) and render dead versions **explicitly dead, NOT omitted** — no size
  claim, no `Unlock`, an "artifact gone — remove?" action on the existing `DELETE`. Omission would
  silently shrink history and mask exactly the drift a soak exists to surface; the dead row is also
  the user's only record the backup ever existed. **(2) (cr)(b) → banked as constraint #7 on the
  multi-storage epic (cl),** not qn.6a, not a near-term patch: no background sweep or
  revalidate-on-read until "storage unreachable" and "artifact gone" are distinguishable states —
  the implementer's do-not-build-a-sweep-that-cannot-tell-them-apart caution is adopted as a hard
  sequencing rule. **(3) (ct) Finding B → a qn.5b CLOSEOUT PATCH (owner: the qn.5b implementer),
  CI-provable, no hardware needed — before or alongside qn.6a.** It is a gap in qn.5b's own design
  (sentinel timing), and the soak makes mid-seed crashes realistic (restarts, OOM, power). Spec
  accepted with three refinements verified against the code: **(a)** the sentinel already lives in
  the device dir OUTSIDE `working/<udid>` (survives the hook's `rm -rf` + `cp -a`), so
  write-before-seed needs no restructuring; **(b)** the completeness flag must be **legacy-safe**:
  an EXISTING sentinel without the new field was written post-seed under the old code and is
  therefore COMPLETE — absent-field must read as valid, or the patch would discard a resumable
  34 GB `working/` on the soak box's first restart after upgrade (shape it accordingly, e.g.
  `seed_in_progress: true` written pre-seed and cleared on success, absent = complete); **(c)** the
  guard applies to BOTH models (`zfs.go` and `namespace.go` share the resume-any-non-empty
  pattern), and the discard path re-seeds with a log line. CI leg: a partial tree with an
  in-progress/absent-complete sentinel must be discarded and re-seeded, never resumed; a dirty
  working from a FAILED BACKUP (complete seed, real sentinel) must still resume — the guard has to
  discriminate the two. **(4) (cu) → option (1) in qn.6a, CONFIRMED,** with the contract shape
  ruled: a `seeding` job phase between `preflight` and `backing_up` (contracts phase-enum
  addition); UI narrates "Preparing — cloning from your last backup…". **Options (3) and (2)
  DECLINED for now:** (3) trades away the clean-snapshot invariant qn.5b just paid for — revisit
  only with soak evidence that the RAW latency, not its visibility, is the complaint; (2) is
  transport-adjacent complexity that would belong near qn.7's audition if ever. (4)-faster-seed is
  already harvested by (cs). **(5) qn.7 evidence — accepted as banked** (roadmap block reviewed);
  the legitimate-idle-pause finding is load-bearing for the liveness-threshold tuning, and the
  session's own on-the-record correction of its two live misreads (a pause is not a deadlock) is
  the process working as designed. Roadmap updated: qn.6a homings flipped to confirmed with the
  ruled contract shapes; epic (cl) gains constraint #7.
- 2026-07-24: (cw) **Finding B CLOSED — the qn.5b `seed_in_progress` guard: a seed killed mid-clone
  is no longer silently resumed into (branch `claude/qn5b-finding-b-seed-guard`, gates-green).** Per
  the (cv) ruling, `workState` gains `seed_in_progress bool` written **true before the seed clone**
  and cleared to **false on success**. A non-empty `working/<udid>` whose sentinel still says
  in-progress is a partial clone (a seed SIGKILLed by the old (cs) timeout, or any crash mid-seed) —
  `WorkDir` now **discards it and re-seeds** instead of resuming (resuming a partial could commit a
  version missing blobs, since the encrypted verify only shard-checks a *full*). **Legacy-safe by Go's
  zero value (the architect's refinement):** an old-code sentinel — written *post*-seed, so complete —
  has no `seed_in_progress` field → decodes to `false` → **resume**, so the first restart after upgrade
  never throws away a resumable 34 GB `working/`. Implemented as a **shared `prepareWorkDir`** both
  backends now call (the two WorkDirs were duplicate lifecycles) so the guard is provably identical
  across models — a small dedup that fell out of "applies to both." CI leg `TestSeedInProgressGuard`
  proves the guard **discriminates** on BOTH models: killed seed → re-seed (a planted TAG is gone),
  completed seed → resume (TAG survives), legacy sentinel → resume (TAG survives). No hardware; storage
  coverage 78.9→79.3%. This closes the last qn.5b-owed item; the remaining routed findings are qn.6a's
  ((cr)/(cu)) and the multi-storage epic's (constraint #7).
- 2026-07-24: (cx) **(cu) ELABORATED with the Operator — the raw-latency mechanisms banked as a
  parked, evidence-gated roadmap block (Later/parked).** The Operator proposed a concrete scheme for
  (cu) option (2): a cheap stand-in target so idevicebackup2 handshakes (and fires the passcode
  prompt) immediately, the real seed running in parallel, `RENAME_EXCHANGE` swapping the seeded tree
  in when ready. Architect checked the idevicebackup2 source rather than guessing: the facts are
  FAVORABLE (pre-request it only stat/reads+rewrites `Info.plist`, remove-then-create so
  alias-safe; manifests are read post-request via `DownloadFiles`; the iOS 16.1+ passcode wait
  fires before the message loop; no long-lived fds — per-message `fopen`, so a mid-run exchange is
  coherent). The Operator's "probing rw too early" caveat mostly dissolves, and "mark it readonly"
  is the wrong tool (it breaks the legitimate Info.plist rewrite; the safe shape is a stand-in with
  copies of the four control files and NO shard aliases). **The real hazard is the LOST RACE:** a
  swap landing after the first write-class device message discards device-uploaded data into the
  doomed stand-in — a version missing blobs, Finding B's failure mode by another road; plausible on
  a tiny incremental (seconds of transfer vs ~23 s seed). So: a dedicated rung with a spike leg, if
  ever. **Architect's challenge, accepted into the bank:** option (3) pre-seed-after-commit achieves
  the same ideal UX with ZERO concurrency — the staleness objection is empty (`latest/` never
  changes between commits), costs are the clean-snapshot invariant (bought for cleanliness, not
  correctness) + copy-backend disk (gate to `SHARED` seeds) — and dominates the stand-in scheme on
  risk-per-UX; the stand-in wins only if the invariant is ruled non-negotiable. **Ruling
  (Operator-agreed): sequence unchanged** — qn.6a `seeding` phase now → soak → only if the raw wait
  (not its visibility) is the complaint, rule between (3) [architect's lean] and the stand-in rung.
  Both candidates + the source-verified facts live in the roadmap's Later/parked block so nothing is
  re-derived from scratch. Interface-facts rule applies: re-verify against the VENDORED build before
  building either.
- 2026-07-24: (cy) **ARCHITECT REVIEW of the Finding B closeout ((cw), branch
  `claude/qn5b-finding-b-seed-guard`): APPROVED + LANDED (main → `b0a859a`, ff-only).** Verified in
  code: the sentinel is written `seed_in_progress:true` BEFORE tree creation and cleared on success;
  the guard discards-and-re-seeds only on a present sentinel still saying in-progress; the (cv)
  legacy-safety refinement is implemented by Go's zero value AND proven by a hand-planted
  legacy-JSON test case; the shared `prepareWorkDir` makes the guard provably identical across both
  models (a real dedup — the two WorkDirs were duplicate lifecycles). Crash-window walk: every kill
  point resolves safely — a crash mid-write of the FIRST sentinel leaves an empty/absent tree that
  bypasses the guard and re-runs; a crash mid-write of the CLEARING sentinel leaves a corrupt
  sentinel only beside a COMPLETE tree, where the read-failure→resume fallback is correct (and the
  torn-write exposure of the sentinel predates this patch, unchanged). `TestSeedInProgressGuard`'s
  TAG discrimination is the exact CI leg (cv) demanded (killed→re-seed, completed→resume,
  legacy→resume, both backends). Privacy sweep clean. **qn.5b is now FULLY closed** — built (cp),
  hardware-proven (ct), all follow-ups routed (cv), Finding B fixed (cw). Chain: **qn.6a (soak UI) →
  freeze**.
- 2026-07-24: (cz) **(cu) latency bank AMENDED after a second Operator discussion — the GATE PATCH
  becomes candidate C and DOMINATES the stand-in scheme; in-process integration assessed and
  declined as a candidate.** The Operator asked whether the dead air is a consequence of running
  idevicebackup2 as a subprocess and whether tighter integration is the ideal fix. Diagnosis
  sharpened: the cause is BLACK-BOX-ness, not subprocess-ness — idevicebackup2's sequence has
  exactly one point where waiting is free (after the `Backup` request = passcode already fired,
  before the message loop), and every workaround is a contortion around not controlling that point.
  **Candidate C (new): patch a `--gate <path>` pause into idevicebackup2 at that point** — quince
  launches immediately (prompt ~1–2 s), seeds in parallel, touches the gate file; deterministic, no
  stand-in, clean-snapshot invariant kept, and it RIDES THE FORK qn.7 ALREADY CARRIES (the #1413
  receive-timeout patch), while every subprocess-supervision property (crash isolation, kill
  matrix, liveness, cancel, transcript parsing) survives untouched. It strictly dominates candidate
  A (stand-in + `exch`): the same overlap with none of the lost-race machinery — A demoted to a
  historical note, resurfacing only if carrying the patched build becomes untenable. **In-process
  (cgo libimobiledevice / Go mobilebackup2) declined as a candidate:** crash isolation lost (the
  kill-matrix hardening assumes a disposable external process), protocol correctness becomes ours
  (against the ruled "hope idevicebackup2 does its job well" posture), and **go-ios verified NOT to
  implement mobilebackup2** — no pure-Go crib exists, we would be first. If ever, it is a
  post-freeze epic justified by accumulated soak + qn.7 chaos evidence that subprocess supervision
  is a persistent tax, never by (cu) alone. **Live fork if the soak indicts the raw wait: B
  (pre-seed — zero external code, costs the clean-snapshot invariant) vs C (gate patch — keeps the
  invariant, costs one more patch on an existing fork). Settle THEN, on soak evidence.** Roadmap
  Later/parked block restructured accordingly (live candidates first, A demoted, in-process note).
- 2026-07-24: (da) **qn.6a BUILT (CI-proven) — soak-ready UI (mobile + offline devices), the LAST rung
  under the current process.** Branch `claude/qn6a-soak-ready-ui`; `make gates` + `make image` +
  `make gates-ui-e2e` green in `quince-dev`; awaiting architect review + land. Spec + friction notes in
  `docs/specs/qn.6a/`. **Both ruled contract changes landed with the build (qn.5b Reset precedent):**
  (1) `missing: bool` on `wire.Version` (§2) — `store.VersionRow.Missing` already existed and was
  honoured everywhere EXCEPT the wire (`toWire` never mapped it), so a gone artifact rendered as a
  normal backup; now crossed to the wire and the UI renders it explicitly dead (no size, no Unlock,
  "artifact gone — remove?" on the existing `DELETE`), never omitted ((cr)(a)/(cv)). (2) `seeding` added
  to the `Job.state` enum between `preflight` and `backing_up` ((cu) opt 1/(cv)). **Rung-local ruling
  recorded (friction #4):** (cv) called it a "phase … (contracts phase-enum addition)", but the contract
  has two candidates — the `Job.state` enum and the open `progress.phase` string. Landed as a **state**
  (with `progress.phase` mirroring): the engine models every lifecycle stage as a state, and the card +
  details panel label off `job.state`, so only a state makes the ruled "Preparing — cloning from your
  last backup…" the headline instead of leaving it at "Preflight" for the ~23 s clone. Non-breaking add.
  **Engine:** `preflight` split into checks-only + a `seeding` step that wraps `storage.Seed`; a seed
  failure terminates `failed` (the qn.5b Finding B sentinel guard owns any partial). **Offline devices
  ((ch), minimal — not a subsystem):** migration `0004_device_identity` + `store` upsert/list, persisted
  identity + last-seen; `Registry.Devices()` unions live presence with `KnownUDIDs()` (= `SELECT DISTINCT
  udid FROM versions`) and returns an offline shell (no transports, persisted name + last-seen +
  last_backup) for a backed-up-but-absent device; `Enrich` persists; a live online→offline card
  transition fires on last-transport detach of a backed-up device (emit `device.detached` then
  `device.updated`), so unplugging a phone mid-session turns its card offline instead of vanishing.
  `Device(udid)` returns the offline shell too (audited: `StartBackup`/`resolveTransport`/preflight all
  gate on `presentOn`, so no behaviour regressed; deviceops/reset now answer "needs connection" instead
  of 404 for a known-offline device — strictly more honest). Version count is derived client-side from
  the versions store (no new field). **Gate-11 findings:** #6 failed-newest "needs attention · Retry"
  companion line on the card (NOT a `last_backup` mutation — the (cj) CORE item; a soak whose failures
  are invisible is worthless); #7 client single-`is_latest`-per-device invariant folded into the versions
  store `upsert` (demote the prior latest on a new `version.created` — kills the two-badges-until-reload
  bug); #10-byte honest labelling — the tool's `(X/Y)` is the CURRENT file, not the backup total, so the
  UI leads with percent + files and labels the pair "current file" (no contract change, the `wire`
  comment pins the meaning); (ck) `kind` dropped from the version card (kept internal/API). **Log-blob
  `SplitFunc` (#3):** a custom `bufio.SplitFunc` splits idevicebackup2's `\r`-redrawn progress into
  per-frame tokens (parser reads the LATEST bytes, not the oldest in a 12 KB blob), and pure-redraw
  frames are dropped from the log ring/WS — one fix for the mangled pane + stale byte counter + bloat.
  **Mobile-first pass ((ch), NOT an IA redesign):** responsive shell (sidebar → phone top-bar), taller
  touch targets on phones, no horizontal overflow, and the log pane / dialogs / version list / history
  reflow; proven at 390×844 by e2e story 5. **Demo** gained an offline device (`attic-ipad`, no
  transport, a live + a DEAD version) so offline + dead-version render are demoable and e2e-provable.
  Coverage: backup 85.2% / device 97.2% / store 81.3%; UI 46 vitest + 5 e2e stories. **Contract
  discipline:** items 5/6 were the only two contract changes, both pre-ruled in (cv); no `PROPOSED (gap)`
  needed. Privacy sweep clean (demo fixtures only — synthetic UDIDs, no serials/LAN IPs). Friction notes
  handed to the revamp (`docs/specs/qn.6a/friction-notes.md`): scattered scope surface, manual
  letter allocation, absent `local/`, the phase-vs-state contract ambiguity. Chain from here: **land qn.6a
  → freeze + process revamp (app soaking on staging).**
- 2026-07-24: (db) **ARCHITECT REVIEW of qn.6a ((da)): APPROVED + LANDED (main → `3a7b068`,
  ff-only). The rung chain is COMPLETE — the frontier is now the CODE FREEZE + PROCESS REVAMP, with
  the app soaking on staging.** Verified in code, not just the report: both contract changes are
  exactly the (cv) shapes (`missing` mapped in `toWire`, dead row = no size/no Unlock/Remove-on-
  DELETE/never omitted; `seeding` between `preflight`/`backing_up` with `progress.phase` mirroring);
  the engine split kept the load-bearing ordering (every preflight REFUSAL still precedes Seed —
  nothing to discard on refusal); startup job-row reconciliation is complement-of-terminal, so a
  daemon killed mid-`seeding` reconciles to `connection_lost` with no enumeration to update and the
  Finding B guard owns the partial tree; `scanFrames` handles the `\r\n`-split-across-reads edge;
  the client single-`is_latest` fix is correctly scoped per-device; `UDIDsWithVersions` includes
  missing-only devices (history rendered dead, not forgotten) and a failed lookup degrades to empty
  rather than blanking the live table; e2e story 5 asserts the real soak claims (overflow ≤ 1 px,
  disabled-with-reason, seeding narration, dead row) at 390×844. Architect re-ran the privacy sweep
  over the full branch diff (warranted — see deviation 1): clean, synthetic demo constants only.
  **Ruling 1 — the state-vs-phase judgment call is ENDORSED and now canon:** (cv)'s "phase-enum
  addition" wording was ambiguous between the `Job.state` enum and the open `progress.phase` string;
  the implementer's reading — `seeding` as a full STATE — is ratified, for the implementer's own
  reason (the card headline reads `job.state`; only a state makes the ruled narration the headline
  during the ~23 s clone) plus one the report didn't claim: the state machine's running states are
  consumed complement-of-terminal throughout, so the add is structurally free. **Two process
  deviations recorded as REVAMP EVIDENCE, not blame:** (1) the branch was pushed to the PUBLIC
  remote before architect review — the landing protocol has the architect land; a pre-review push
  makes an unreviewed privacy leak irreversible in principle (this one was clean; the remote branch
  is deleted post-land). The implementer flagged the push itself as unexplained ("wasn't in
  protocol"), which is exactly the honesty the process wants. (2) The contract diffs were landed
  with the build rather than proposed early for sign-off as the kickoff asked — functionally
  mitigated here (the shapes were pre-ruled and the ONE ambiguity was flagged for review, which is
  what early sign-off exists to catch), but the mitigation relied on the implementer's judgment,
  not the process. Both join the friction pile: the revamp should make the landing/proposal
  protocol MECHANICAL (a checklist the session can't drift past), not narrative. **Observation
  banked for qn.7 (no action now):** `storage.Seed` takes no context — a cancel during a hung seed
  waits on the 30-min backstop, not the job cancel; pre-existing shape (unchanged since qn.5b),
  belongs with qn.7's liveness/chaos work. **Soak notes for the Operator:** redeploy staging from
  main `3a7b068` (staging still runs the hardware-day build — it predates the Finding B guard AND
  qn.6a); migration 0004 applies on first start; avoid changing the backup password mid-soak
  (#9b, qn.7). **The daily-driver arc that began at (by) is DONE — qn.4c, qn.5, qn.5b, qn.6a all
  landed; the app is soak-ready. Next session under a NEW process.**
- 2026-07-24: (dc) **CORRECTION to (db) deviation 1 (Operator clarified): the qn.6a push was NOT
  unprompted.** The implementer initially did not push; the push followed the Operator's
  instruction "Now commit and I'll send it to architect for review. Then deploy to staging." So the
  accurate account: an instruction ambiguous about TRANSPORT — "send it to architect" (the
  architect reviews the local branch in the shared checkout; no push needed) and "deploy to
  staging" (implies publishing somewhere) — was silently resolved toward the IRREVERSIBLE reading
  (push to the public remote) instead of the reversible one, with no note of the interpretation
  taken. The report inconsistency ("not pushed — ready for review" at top, a PR link at bottom) is
  the same event: the report was drafted pre-push and not reconciled after the late push — state
  honesty applies to reports too; a report whose facts change after drafting gets reconciled, not
  appended to. **The revamp lesson sharpens rather than softens:** this was a REASONABLE
  instruction and a PLAUSIBLE interpretation — which is exactly why the fix is structural, not
  behavioral. The mechanical landing protocol should pin who pushes and when (the architect
  pushes, at landing; the implementer never pushes), so a casual "send it" cannot be read as
  authorization to publish, and on a public repo the default resolution of any transport ambiguity
  is the reversible one. (db)'s "the implementer flagged the push as unexplained" is also
  corrected: that flag was the OPERATOR's, in relay.
- 2026-07-24: (dd) **qn.6a SOAK-POLISH BATCH reviewed + landed (9 commits, main → `ef897eb`) — the
  soak's first real yield, delivered OUT of process and adjudicated honestly.** The Operator used
  the app from a phone immediately after qn.6a landed and worked a polish batch directly with the
  implementer — no spec, no report, no letter, scope beyond the ruled qn.6a items. Architect review
  (code-level, every commit): **all nine are genuine soak findings, approved.** Highlights: **the
  iOS PWA dead-socket fix** (a suspended PWA's WebSocket dies WITHOUT `onclose`, so the old
  reconnect skipped the non-null socket forever — resume listeners now drop the stale socket, reset
  backoff, and revalidate auth after long suspensions); **the SPA cache policy** (`no-cache` on
  `index.html`/non-hashed assets, `immutable` on hashed `assets/` — without it a redeploy is
  invisible behind Safari's cache, which would have silently corrupted the soak's own evidence);
  **exactly one primary action per card** (Retry REPLACES "Back up now" when the newest attempt
  failed, failure text as context — an improvement on the landed #6 shape, semantics preserved);
  Retry only on the LATEST intent in history (an old failed intent's "retry" is just "back up now"
  with extra confusion); capped history + Show-all; live-ticking relative times (`useNow`);
  the disabled qn.8 "Unlock" placeholder → a quiet chevron (honest for unencrypted versions too);
  PWA manifest + wordmark icons (architect inspected the PNGs); mobile scroll-region architecture +
  standalone/landscape safe-areas; login layout. **Verification:** the branch had no gates run and
  this batch shipped no report — architect pushed it and opened PR #1 solely to run the CI ladder:
  gates + image + e2e ALL GREEN in the pinned toolchain; whole-diff privacy sweep clean. **Process
  adjudication (revamp evidence, not blame):** the Operator self-reported the deviation ("not
  quite by the process… a lot out of scope") and the batch is exactly what post-freeze soak
  maintenance will look like — the CURRENT process has no lane for "small verified polish under
  soak" short of a full rung, which is WHY it happened out of process. The revamp should design
  that lane (a lightweight verified-batch flow: CI-green + architect review + letter, no
  spec/report ceremony), rather than pretend every change is a rung. Also formalized here: with no
  local toolchain on the architect's machine, **PR-triggered CI is now the architect's standing
  verification route for unverified branches** (the PR is a CI vehicle; landing stays ff-only from
  the CLI). Soak note: the staging redeploy should now come from `ef897eb`, and thanks to the cache
  fix THIS is the last redeploy the phone might need a manual cache-clear to pick up.
- 2026-07-24: (de) **qn.6b "transport patience" INSERTED pre-freeze — the LAST pre-freeze insert,
  with the bar made explicit.** Chain: the Operator proposed pulling ALL of qn.7 pre-freeze (two
  reasons from the first soak day: a Wi-Fi backup hang — "probably WiFi drop, I don't know" — and
  the Backup-now→passcode wait being "really annoying" even WITH the seeding narration); architect
  counter-proposed a split (full qn.7 = weeks of chaos-suite/audition/tuning work that delays the
  overdue revamp — today alone produced three letters of process-deviation evidence); Operator
  ruled the split and named the pre-freeze half **qn.6b** (consistent with the insert convention;
  qn.7 keeps its name and stays post-freeze). **Why pre-freeze at all:** the soak's premise is
  daily use; a hanging Wi-Fi backup is what makes the Operator quietly stop using the app, killing
  the soak and the freeze plan with it. **qn.6b scope (small, coherent):** (1) the patched
  libimobiledevice build — 30 s → 15 min receive timeout (upstream #1413), as an IN-TREE PATCH
  FILE applied to the pinned upstream tag at image build (no hosted fork); (2) **the gate patch —
  candidate C — on the same fork**, which SETTLES the (cx)/(cz) evidence gate (the Operator's
  complaint is the raw wait despite the narration = exactly the evidence the gate demanded);
  spike-first per (cz), with candidate B (pre-seed) as the in-rung fallback so the rung cannot
  stall; (3) liveness thresholds retuned to the 15-min reality — inseparable from (1), else "fails
  too fast" becomes "looks hung forever"; both (ct) sides held: no panic on legitimate pauses,
  honest eventual dead-link classification; (4) **the 6a-soak hang as the acceptance case** —
  Operator to capture the job row/log/wait duration BEFORE a redeploy loses it; whether the
  sampler fired decides tuning-vs-bug. **qn.7 keeps:** chaos suite, netmuxd-USB audition,
  restart-policy tuning, #2, full #8, #9b, #10-percent, UX copy. **The last-insert rule:** a
  pre-freeze insert is justified ONLY by a defect that stops daily use; qn.6b is the fourth insert
  ((by)/(cg)/(ch)/(de)) and the final one — nothing else on the books meets the bar. Roadmap: qn.6b
  block added before M4; qn.7 block amended; the Later/parked seed-latency block flipped to
  GATE-MET/SETTLED→C (decision record retained).
- 2026-07-24: (dg) **qn.6b SPEC REVIEWED — APPROVED WITH AMENDMENTS; build may start once they are
  folded in (no re-review needed pre-build).** Spec at `docs/specs/qn.6b/qn.6b.md` ((df) reserved
  for the build entry). The spike's two corrections to the kickoff brief are ACCEPTED and the
  looked-up rule vindicated against the architect's own stale figures: Alpine 3.24 ships
  libimobiledevice `1.4.0-r0` (pin `LIBIMOBILEDEVICE_REF=1.4.0`), and `configure.ac` requires the
  undocumented 4th dep `libtatsu` (≥1.0.3; Alpine has 1.0.5). The spike's `-5 RECEIVE_TIMEOUT`
  finding is ENDORSED as the rung's load-bearing fact: idevicebackup2 never exits on pure silence
  (the retry is PRINT_VERBOSE(2), suppressed), so quince's sampler is the SOLE authority for a
  cleanly-idle dead link — and note the corollary: the UNPATCHED tool also loops `-5` forever (at
  30 s intervals), so the 6a-soak hang was likely already this shape; the Operator's capture still
  decides tuning-vs-bug exactly as item 4 forks. The 18-min `LivenessTimeout` (= tool's 15 m + 3 m
  margin) + `toolReceiveTimeout` mirror constant + the mechanical guard test are approved as
  specified. Candidate-C engine sequencing (gate → Info.plist capture/seed/restore → release)
  approved; lab-owed device-tolerance leg + candidate-B fallback per (de) confirmed.
  **AMENDMENT A (substantive): the 15-min default must not leak into non-backup device ops.**
  Patch `0001` raises the DEFAULT receive timeout for every libimobiledevice-backed binary in the
  image — and item 1 replaces the apk tools with the patched build, so pairing, enrichment reads,
  and the live encryption re-read ((i)-B) all inherit 15-min patience. A wedged lockdown read
  during preflight/pairing would then sit 15 minutes where it used to fail in 30 s — a UX
  regression hiding inside a reliability rung. Required: an audit story asserting every non-backup
  tool invocation runs under a Go-side context bound (≲60 s); any unbounded call found is bounded
  IN THIS RUNG (direct consequence of item 1, in scope). CI-provable.
  **Amendment B (minor, prose):** item 2 step-3 lists the Info.plist write after the `Backup`
  request, but the spec's own line numbers (2242/2243 write < 2261 request) put it BEFORE — which
  is *better* for the engine (the seed-wait target appears within ~1 s of launch, not gated on the
  user's passcode); make the prose match the lines so the seed-wait timeout rationale is grounded.
  **Amendment C (minor, one sentence):** state that a quince-daemon crash mid-gate cannot orphan a
  forever-polling tool — the tool is a child in the same container and dies with it (container
  lifecycle); the in-tool `quit_flag` covers the supervised-cancel path.
  Item 4's capture remains the Operator's (staging is his box); stories 8–10 sequencing as
  proposed. Contract stance (NONE) confirmed. Letters: (df) build, (dg) this review.
- 2026-07-24: (dh) **qn.6b spec DELTA reviewed after a relay-ordering slip — the capture-driven
  item-3/item-4 edits are now ACTUALLY approved; the (dg) build-go stands.** What happened: the
  Operator relayed the (dg) approval into the implementer session mid-turn, and it landed AFTER the
  implementer had folded the incident capture into the spec (+35/−13 on items 3/4) — so the
  approval appeared to cover text it had never reviewed. The Operator caught and reported the slip
  himself. Architect has now reviewed the delta directly in the worktree: **approved.** The item-3
  edits fold the (dg) corollary faithfully and sharpen it into the two-hang-shapes taxonomy (`-4`
  SSL/reset → tool exits `failed` fast; `-5`-forever clean idle → only the sampler ends it). The
  item-4 rewrite is endorsed, ESPECIALLY its honest residual: the captured `-4` fired at ~10 s of
  silence — faster than even the unpatched 30 s timeout would cleanly expire — because `-4` is an
  SSL-layer error on a mid-record stall, so the patch's cure for `-4` is EMPIRICALLY-BACKED
  (upstream #1413 reports + (ct)), not mechanically proven; story 9 is genuinely decisive; a
  story-9 failure is pre-classified as a qn.7 finding (retry-on-`-4` / #8 reclassification), not a
  qn.6b blocker. **Incident verdict ratified:** job 01KY95VPJ8WW9ESN3EFMRGMRFZ died at ~44 s via
  `outcomeProcErr` (the tool's own `-4` exit, verified at the engine call site) — the sampler never
  fired, quince behaved correctly (dirty `working/` kept, resume-no-re-seed worked). Item 4 = tool
  patience, item 1 is the fix. **Perception reconciled (no new work):** the Operator EXPERIENCED a
  hang, but the job failed in 44 s — the missing layer is plausibly the pre-(dd) PWA dead-socket UI
  staleness (the phone showed a frozen "backing up" over a dead WebSocket; fixed and landed in the
  (dd) polish batch). The full user-visible incident is thus covered by (dd) [already landed] +
  item 1 [this rung]. **Contingency pre-ruled to protect the last-insert rule ((de)):** if story 9
  shows the patch does NOT cure this `-4`, finishing the SAME defect is a CONTINUATION of the (de)
  insert's mandate (the defect still stops daily use), scoped to the minimal bounded retry or
  reclassification — it is not a new insert and does not reopen the bar. Nit for the spec: item 4
  credits the pcap root-cause "(architect, ratified (ct))" — the wire dive was the qn.5b hardware
  implementer's, ratified by the architect in (cv); fix the parenthetical. Amendments A/B/C from
  (dg) stand unchanged. **Revamp evidence (the third relay artifact after (dc)/(dd)):**
  cross-session relay has no ordering guarantee, so an approval can silently drift onto newer text
  — the revamped protocol should make approvals reference WHAT was approved (a spec revision
  marker/section list), so a mistimed relay cannot widen a ruling's coverage.
- 2026-07-24: (df) **qn.6b BUILT (CI-proven) — transport patience: patched-from-source
  libimobiledevice + the `--gate` candidate-C seed overlap + the liveness retune + amendment A.**
  Branch `claude/quince-qn6b-wifi-backup-64162c`; **not pushed** (architect lands ff-only via PR-CI,
  (dd)). `make gates` + `make image` + `make gates-ui-e2e` green in `quince-dev`; coverage backup
  83.5% / deviceops 81.5% / storage 78.1%. Spike facts all verified against upstream `1.4.0`
  (`docs/specs/qn.6b/spike-libimobiledevice.md`); the two kickoff-brief corrections it forced (Alpine
  ships `1.4.0` not `1.1.1_git20250201`; the undocumented `libtatsu` build dep) held. **(1) Patched
  build:** `LIBIMOBILEDEVICE_REF=1.4.0` in `versions.env`, built from source in a new Dockerfile
  stage (only libimobiledevice — Alpine 3.24 ships every dep); two in-tree patch files
  (`deploy/patches/libimobiledevice/`, applied via `git apply`, verified to apply against a pristine
  tag): `0001` `30000`→`900000` in `property_list_service.c`+`service.c` (#1413), `0002` the `--gate`
  flag at `idevicebackup2.c`'s single free point (post-Backup-request/pre-loop, spike C11). Runtime
  `idevicebackup2 --help` lists `--gate`; the on-disk lib is `1.4.0-dirty` (the COPY overwrites the
  apk copy that usbmuxd's soname dep pulls in — same soname, so everything links the patched lib);
  `-progs` dropped; `-Werror` sed'd off `configure.ac:88` for the vendored build; `--without-cython`.
  **(2) Candidate C:** the storage `Seed` split into `PrepareWork` (fast: resume-or-prepare, reports
  `seedPending`) + `SeedWork` (the clone; `finishSeed` clears `working/<udid>` first so the clone
  sees a clean dst after the tool created it). Engine `superviseGatedSeed`: launch gated → capture
  the fresh `Info.plist` (stability-checked read) → clone → restore it over `latest`'s → open the
  gate → run the sampler loop; `supervise` refactored into `startTool`+`runToolLoop` shared with the
  non-gated resume path. Source-verified the sequencing is race-free (Info.plist written before the
  request/passcode; tool holds no fd into the target; the engine orders capture→clone→restore
  strictly). `TestStoryGatedSeedOverlap` proves the committed version keeps the FRESH `Info.plist`
  across the clone and the passcode is narrated during seeding; `TestStoryResumeSkipsTheGate` proves
  a resume bypasses the gate. **(3) Liveness retune:** `LivenessTimeout` 15m→**18m** with a
  `toolReceiveTimeout=15m` mirror constant + `TestLivenessBackstopExceedsToolTimeout` guarding
  `backstop > tool`. The load-bearing spike finding reshaped this: a cleanly-idle dead link makes
  idevicebackup2 loop `MOBILEBACKUP2_E_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT` (-5) FOREVER without exiting
  (`idevicebackup2.c:2504`), so the sampler is the SOLE authority there — the retune out-waits the
  tool's own patience so a flap the tool would ride out is never SIGKILLed. `-4` (SSL/reset)
  classification stays qn.7 (#8). **Amendment A ((dg)):** audited `deviceops`/`device` — the only
  unbounded non-backup tool call (`Manager.Validate`) is now bounded by `deviceOpTimeout=30s`; the
  interactive ops (pair 2m / encryption 5m) already cap the child < 15m; enrichment reads already
  20s. `TestValidateBoundedGoSide` proves a wedged read returns in the bound, not 15 min.
  **Item-4 verdict (the captured Wi-Fi hang):** the DB error `backup_failed | backup failed: Could
  not receive from mobilebackup2 (-4)` at ~44 s is `engine.go`'s `outcomeProcErr` — the tool's OWN
  exit, NOT the sampler (`outcomeTimeout`). So it is neither a quince tuning miss nor a liveness bug;
  it is idevicebackup2 giving up too fast on a ~10 s recoverable drop — exactly what item 1 targets —
  and quince behaved correctly (kept the dirty `working/`, clean discard-for-retry). Whether the
  timeout raise fixes THIS `-4` is empirically-backed-not-mechanically-proven (the `-4` fires faster
  than a clean timeout; some `-4` are device resets a timeout can't cure), so **story 9 is genuinely
  decisive**, not a formality. **Contract changes: NONE** (enum values/states reused; the `Storage`
  Go seam gained methods, an internal interface, not a frozen contract). **Docs:** stack D2 (patched
  build + gate + the amendment-A note), design §4 (18-min backstop rationale + the `seeding` state
  added to the state diagram — a qn.6a drift fixed here). **Privacy:** swept clean (`make
  privacy-check` + explicit UDID/IP scan); the (ct) pcap fixtures stay LOCAL-ONLY and were never
  referenced. **Known-untested (declared debt):** the gated-seed ERROR branches (SeedWork fails
  mid-gate, tool exits before Info.plist, gate-write fails, cancel during the gated seed) are not
  exercised — the happy path + resume-bypass are, and each error maps to the same terminal shapes the
  non-gated paths already test. **Lab-owed (declared, sequenced with the Operator):** story 9 (re-run
  the `-4` hang on the patched build), story 10 (15-min patience across a real flap → succeeded or an
  honest eventual terminal), story 11 (gate vs a real device: ~1–2 s passcode + ~20 s tolerance;
  candidate B is the in-rung fallback if the tolerance leg fails). Friction notes: the letter/rebase
  reconciliation (main advanced to (dh) while this built on a (de) base — code untouched, only the
  decisions-log append reconciles); `make fmt` needed after struct-comment edits ([[quince-dev-loop]]).
- 2026-07-24: (dj) **ARCHITECT REVIEW of qn.6b ((df)): APPROVED + LANDED (rebased onto (dh) main,
  PR #2 CI fully green — gates/image/e2e — then ff-only to main `3720f84`).** The image job's green
  is itself a milestone: the first fresh-clone CI proof of the from-source patched libimobiledevice
  stage. Verified in the diff, not the report: patch `0001` touches exactly the two default-timeout
  call sites with rationale comments; `0002`'s gate wait sits inside the Backup-request success
  branch after the passcode observe, `quit_flag` breaks it, empty-arg guarded — and `git apply
  --verbose` at image build makes the patches fail loudly on upstream drift. The gated-seed engine
  flow is careful where it matters: the stale gate file is removed BEFORE launch (a crashed
  attempt's leftover would silently disarm the pause), the gate lives in the device dir out of the
  clone's `rm -rf` reach, an early tool exit hands off to the sampler loop so the TOOL's error
  surfaces (not a synthetic seed error), `abort()` reaps fully, and the Info.plist read is
  stabilized against partial writes. The `PrepareWork`/`SeedWork` split PRESERVES the Finding B
  guard exactly (`seed_in_progress` written in the fast phase before the tool touches the tree,
  cleared only after a successful clone; `WorkDir = PrepareWork + SeedWork` so the qn.5b tests
  still bind). Amendment A landed thoughtfully (`deviceOpTimeout` 30 s on the one unbounded
  `Validate`; the interactive ops' longer bounds explained, not blindly capped; wedged-read test).
  Amendments B/C folded; privacy sweep clean; the soname-overwrite quirk (apk lib via usbmuxd's
  dep, patched COPY wins by layer order, `1.4.0-dirty` fingerprint) surfaced honestly. **One (dh)
  item was NOT folded — the pcap attribution parenthetical — fixed by the architect in this
  commit** (spec now credits the qn.5b hardware implementer's wire dive, ratified (cv)). Rebase
  note: the predicted trivial case (both-appended log entries; resolved chronologically
  (dg)/(dh)/(df)). Declared-untested error branches accepted as debt (each maps to terminal shapes
  the non-gated paths already test). **Owed from here: lab stories 9/10/11 on the Operator's
  patched-image redeploy** — story 11 (gate vs the real 34 GB device over the real zfs hook) is
  the candidate-C/B decision point; story 9 (does the patch actually ride out the captured `-4`?)
  is the rung's honest heart. The story-4 e2e flake fix ((di)) is in review on its own branch.
  **After the lab legs: the CODE FREEZE + PROCESS REVAMP.**
- 2026-07-24: (di) **e2e story-4 FLAKE fixed under the soak-maintenance lane ((dd)) — a test-only
  change; two distinct bugs, diagnosed honestly, neither a UI defect.** CI run `30108238903` (job
  `e2e`, on main `c5a7776` — a DOCS-ONLY commit; the prior run on identical code was green → flake,
  not regression) failed `story4-backup-now.spec.ts:22` two different ways across the attempt + its
  Playwright retry. **Bug 1 — strict-mode violation at the second cancel assertion:**
  `getByText(/backup cancelled/i)` resolved to 2 elements. Traced to source, NOT a double-render:
  both are legitimate `JobHistory` intent-group summaries (`groupByIntent` → "Backup cancelled"),
  and by that point the test has cancelled TWO jobs — the retried seed-intent and the fresh
  backup-now intent — so two groups honestly read cancelled (DeviceCard, the other suspect, isn't
  even mounted on the details page). It flaked rather than always-failed because `wire.Now()` is
  second-precision RFC3339, so the assertion sometimes fired in the window before the 2nd cancel
  re-rendered (1 match) and sometimes after (2 → strict violation). **Fix:** assert on the COUNT
  delta of an EXACT-text locator (`getByText("Backup cancelled", { exact: true })` — the capital-B
  summary, excluding the lowercase "backup cancelled" job-log line) via `toHaveCount(before+1)`.
  Count-delta is (a) immune to the newest-first ordering tie on a shared whole-second timestamp,
  (b) never trips strict mode with >1 cancelled group, (c) transient-tolerant (it polls to the
  settled value rather than hard-failing on a momentary 2, which is exactly what bare `toBeVisible`
  could not do). **Bug 2 — `retry-backup` absent on Playwright retry #1:** test-idempotence. The e2e
  demo server is SHARED and never reseeds per test, so the failed primary attempt already advanced
  spare-iphone's latest intent past the one-shot seeded `connection_lost` backup; Retry (latest-
  intent-only since qn.6a) is gone by the retry. **Fix:** guard the retry leg on
  `testInfo.retry === 0` — the primary attempt always runs against a fresh container (pristine seed)
  so it HARD-asserts the Retry affordance (regression guard preserved, coverage undiminished on
  every normal run); a genuine Playwright retry skips the now-invalid precondition and still
  exercises the backup-now/cancel leg. **Surface:** `ui/e2e/story4-backup-now.spec.ts` only (+30/−10);
  no engine/httpapi/ui-src/internal-demo change — deliberately, since qn.6b builds the engine/deploy
  surface in a parallel worktree (its uncommitted `internal/backup/backup.go` + `deploy/Dockerfile`
  were confirmed untouched). **Verification** (isolated dev CT `pct clone`d off qn.6b's box, per the
  one-project-one-CT rule): story4-test1 ×10 against a fresh seed with `--retries=0` → **10/10**
  (bug 1 gone under the strictest setting, no retry masking); a forced primary-fail against a
  consumed seed with `--retries=1` → primary fails on the absent Retry, Playwright retry recovers →
  **exit 0** (bug 2 guard proven end to end — old code would fail both attempts); full e2e suite ×3
  fresh containers → **9/9** each (no collateral breakage); **`make gates` green** (go `-race` all
  ok + golangci 0 issues, vault ruff/`mypy --strict`/pytest, ui typecheck/eslint/vitest 55·55/build).
  The run's 429 action-download backoff annotations were infra noise (recovered), not the failure —
  ignored per the brief. **Process:** soak-maintenance ((dd)) — CI-green + architect review + this
  letter, no spec/report ceremony; branch `claude/e2e-story4-flake`, NOT pushed (architect verifies
  via PR-triggered CI and lands ff-only); whole-diff privacy sweep clean. **Friction / revamp
  evidence:** (1) the shared long-lived `--demo` server is a good fidelity choice but has no per-test
  reset, so any test that CONSUMES a one-shot seeded precondition is non-idempotent under a
  Playwright retry — the clean fix (a demo reseed endpoint the e2e can call in `beforeEach`) was
  out of surface here (needs httpapi, which qn.6b owns); the revamp should decide whether the demo
  provider grows a test-only reset so retry-idempotence stops living in per-test guards. (2) Two
  parallel sessions sharing one dev box is a real hazard — `quince-dev` (CT 110) held qn.6b's
  uncommitted engine diff, so a whole-tree rsync would have clobbered it; the lane needs an explicit
  "which CT is mine" rule for concurrent work (this fix used a throwaway clone, CT 116).
- 2026-07-24: (dk) **ARCHITECT REVIEW of the story-4 flake fix ((di)): APPROVED + LANDED (PR #3 CI
  green, ff-only to main `a45a307`).** Reviewed on the diff: bug 1's diagnosis traced to source
  (two legitimate intent-group summaries; DeviceCard not even mounted; the second-precision
  timestamp explains WHY it flaked) and the count-delta fix is strictly STRONGER than the bare
  `toBeVisible` it replaces (which could pass vacuously against a pre-existing cancelled group).
  Bug 2's `testInfo.retry === 0` guard accepted with the trade-off NAMED: a genuine
  Retry-affordance regression would surface as persistent fail-then-pass-on-retry (CI green,
  flake-annotated) rather than red — acceptable because the affordance has direct unit coverage
  (`JobHistory.test.tsx`, (dd)), so the e2e leg is defense-in-depth, not the only guard; the
  per-test-reseed alternative needs demo-server app code and stays a candidate for qn.7's chaos
  work if the guard ever bites. Repeat-proof verified as demanded by the kickoff (story 4 ×10 at
  zero retries, forced-primary-fail recovery, suite ×3). **The pre-freeze board is now clear of
  everything except the qn.6b LAB LEGS (stories 9/10/11, Operator's patched-image redeploy) —
  then the CODE FREEZE + PROCESS REVAMP.**
- 2026-07-24: (dl) **SPACE SCARE resolved — the reflink accounting trap's SECOND ambush, this time
  via the snapshot columns; no space is being wasted.** The Operator saw `zfs list -o space` bill
  ~177 GB for the two lab devices (three iPhone snapshots at ~33.9 GB "unique" each, `USEDDS`
  68.2 GB) and reasonably read it as a design failure. Pool ledger says otherwise: `bclonesaved
  122G` / `bcloneused 37.0G` → **actual physical spend ≈ 55 GB** (one shared tree of blocks + real
  per-generation deltas). **The signature, now canon (stack D5):** under the reclone-per-generation
  lifecycle, the NEWEST snapshot bills ~0 unique (the head shares its block pointers) and EVERY
  OLDER generation bills ~the full tree (the next seed's exchange replaced all pointers, making the
  old snapshot sole referent of its pointer set while the physical blocks stay BRT-shared) — so
  `USEDSNAP` grows ~full-size per generation *by construction*, and the listing looks like N full
  copies. It is the (bf) trap wearing a new column. Diagnosis rule unchanged and re-vindicated:
  pool ledger (`zpool get bcloneused,bclonesaved`), never `zfs list`/`du`. The lab listing's
  newest-snapshot values (548K iPhone / 15.6M iPad) were the tell — real duplication cannot produce
  a free newest snapshot. **Two real items extracted:** (1) the pre-qn.5b 07-22 snapshots (ruled
  disposable in (cv)'s hardware-day list) are STILL alive — Operator to `zfs destroy`; (2) NEW,
  previously unbanked: **`zfs send` does not preserve block cloning**, so a syncoid/replication
  target pays every `@quince-*` snapshot at FULL rematerialized size — snapshot retention is a real
  capacity knob on replicas (origin pool: ~free), and retention policy should be set before a
  daily-soak year of generations meets an offsite pool. Routed: the retention/replication-cost note
  lives in stack D5; a retention default is qn.7-or-freeze-exit material, not urgent (the origin
  pool is unaffected; the Operator's syncoid replica is the only exposure and is his to watch until
  then).
- 2026-07-25: (dm) **qn.6b LAB LEGS RUN on real hardware — stories 9/10/11 validated; candidate C +
  liveness patience + kept-dirty-working RESUME-TO-COMPLETION all PROVEN; the bad-link `-4` resilience
  characterized live and routed to qn.7. qn.6b's lab debt is CLEARED.** Session on staging (zfs HOOK
  mode, the lab iPhone over Wi-Fi/netmuxd), redeployed to the qn.6b image; two full committed backups
  produced. **Story 11 (candidate C / gate) PASS:** the on-device passcode fired in ~1–2 s (Operator-
  confirmed), the seed ran DURING the gate hold (`hook-reflink`, verdict `SHARED`, zero-space), and the
  device tolerated the ~20 s gate hold on the real hook backend — the zfs-hook candidate-C path (only
  proven-by-equivalence in CI, its input to the hook being identical to the landed non-gated seed) works
  for real. **Story 10 (15-min patience) PASS, twice:** (a) a near-AP backup rode out an app_limited
  pause → committed; (b) the winning resume rode through a MULTI-MINUTE DEVICE-SIDE pause — the tool
  blocked with zero transfer while the device recomputed the delta of a 61 % partial against the
  ~133 k-file base (netmuxd heartbeats stayed healthy → device alive, just busy) — and quince held
  `active`, NO false kill, then it resumed. Strongest liveness demonstration yet: a 30 s tool timeout
  (pre-patch) during that device-side pause is exactly what would have tripped a spurious `-4`.
  **Story 9 (the bad-link `-4`) — the HONEST BOUNDARY, characterized:** in a marginal bedroom spot the
  backup `-4`'d repeatedly with WILD variance (48 s/0 %, 31 min/61 %, 34 s/0 %) — the variance itself is
  the tell (an unstable link, not a deterministic bug; (ct)'s "failure timing varied" again). The patched
  receive timeout does NOT cure a `-4` from a genuine connection drop (a `-4` is an SSL-layer error that
  fires immediately on the reset, independent of the timeout) — BUT it dramatically extended survival
  (48 s → 31 min) AND the kept-dirty-working RESUME accumulated progress ACROSS attempts to a complete,
  committed 13-min backup once the phone was stationary. **Resume-to-completion proven end-to-end** (fail
  → resume → 61 % → resume → success), dataset clean (`latest/` only) after. **Root cause diagnosed live
  (Operator + implementer): band roaming.** The bedroom sits at the 2.4/5 GHz range boundary, so band-
  steering FLAPS the phone between bands (confirmed BOTH directions via the router's client list — band +
  a ~2-min reconnect age coinciding with each failure); each flap resets the mux TLS connection → `-4`.
  Corroborated by netmuxd reconnect bursts at each failure and `Heartbeat(SleepyTime→Timeout)`. Phone-
  sleep (`SleepyTime`, the nightstand doze) is a secondary contributor. **THE PROTOCOL FLOOR (analyzed,
  canon for qn.7):** a dropped mobilebackup2 session CANNOT be rescued in-flight at ANY layer — TLS
  session state is bound to the dead connection (netmuxd re-announces but a fresh mux channel can't carry
  the old TLS session; TLS has no mid-stream reconnect), and mobilebackup2 has no session-reattach.
  Recovery is ALWAYS a new backup request that resumes the on-disk snapshot (kept-dirty-working, no
  re-transfer) + an iOS per-backup passcode re-prompt. "Survive a roam in-flight" is off the table for
  everyone (us, libimobiledevice, netmuxd); "auto-resume after it" is the only path. **quince behaved
  correctly throughout:** honest `-4` messages (never "exit status"), kept-dirty-working with the
  last-good version noted, `active` liveness through every legitimate pause (no false kill), clean commit
  → `latest/`-only. **qn.7 items surfaced, now well-characterized:** (1) AUTO-retry on drop/reconnect so
  the accumulate-to-completion is automatic, not babysat; (2) `-4`→`connection_lost` reclassification
  (#8) so a Wi-Fi drop reads honestly, not as a hard `failed`; (3) the passcode-window question — does a
  retry inside iOS's recent-unlock window skip the prompt? (decides seamless-vs-one-tap for auto-retry);
  (4) a definitive netmuxd-DEBUG + pcap of roam-vs-signal-vs-sleep as qn.7 chaos input (offered, not
  taken tonight); (5) network mitigation (stable band for backups) documented HONESTLY as a workaround,
  NOT the primary answer (band-steering is standard; the product must survive it via auto-resume). **NET:
  qn.6b delivers on real hardware** — fast passcode (C), pause-tolerance + extended survival (the
  timeout), device-pause patience (the retune), and resume-to-completion (kept-dirty-working). The
  bad-link `-4` is a well-scoped qn.7 problem, not a qn.6b defect. Lab debt CLEARED; next is the CODE
  FREEZE + PROCESS REVAMP, with qn.7 (Wi-Fi hardening) carrying the auto-resume + reclassification work.
- 2026-07-25: (dn) **ARCHITECT REVIEW of the qn.6b lab session ((dm)): validated and landed
  (`5e92a7b`); the (dh) story-9 contingency is formally DISCHARGED — the freeze is unblocked.**
  The session proved everything qn.6b built (candidate C on the real hook with a `SHARED` seed
  during the gate hold; the 18-min patience holding `active` through a multi-minute device-side
  delta-recompute — the strongest liveness demonstration to date; resume-to-completion
  accumulating a committed backup across `-4` attempts) and — the part that earns the "tough
  season" — characterized the one thing the patch was NEVER mechanically proven to fix. **The
  spec's honest-residual framing is vindicated exactly as written ((dh)):** the `-4` from a
  genuine connection drop is not cured by patience (an SSL-layer reset fires regardless of
  timeout), and the session went further than the spec asked — root-causing it live to band
  roaming at the 2.4/5 GHz boundary and establishing the PROTOCOL FLOOR (no in-flight rescue
  exists at any layer; recovery is always resume). **The (dh) contingency ruling — "if story 9
  fails, finishing the same defect continues the (de) insert" — is DISCHARGED, not invoked, on
  its own premise:** the insert bar is a defect that STOPS DAILY USE, and the session showed the
  residual defect no longer does — it is location-conditional (a marginal band-boundary spot),
  survival extended ~40× (48 s → 31 min), every failure lands honestly with a one-tap Retry
  ((dd) UI) that accumulates to completion, and two clean commits happened the same night from a
  normal spot. What remains is a HARDENING gap (babysat retries in marginal spots), which is
  qn.7's charter by definition — and the soak will measure its real frequency, which is exactly
  the evidence qn.7's auto-resume design wants. qn.7's sharpened scope (auto-retry-on-reconnect +
  resume, `-4`→`connection_lost`, the passcode-window question, the roam-vs-sleep chaos capture,
  network workaround documented as workaround) is ratified as banked in the roadmap. Dashboard
  row tidied (two stale "owed" phrases). **The pre-freeze board is CLEAR — the next act is the
  CODE FREEZE + PROCESS REVAMP**, with the app soaking on a build whose transport story is now
  hardware-proven end to end.
- 2026-07-25: (do) **The 2026-07-24 storage-thread discussion BANKED (the space-scare's productive
  tail): the `zfs-native` lifecycle is now epic-(cl) candidate mode #8; the clone-promote/
  snapshot-as-latest alternative recorded beside it; the cp-would-not-help/births-not-sharing
  fact added to the (dl) stack note.** Chain of the discussion, for the record: the (dl) send-cost
  finding → Operator asked whether a genuine `cp` seed would spare the replica (NO — send size is
  driven by block births, not physical sharing; both cp and reflink mint newborn trees per
  generation; reflink is origin-side-win, send-neutral; levers = retention / replica-side
  `dedup=on` / content-addressed channel — now in stack D5) → Operator asked whether the newest
  snapshot could BE the mounted read surface (possible; clone-promote is the full form; rejected
  for THIS topology: per-backup privileged mount choreography through host→LXC→OCI, EXDEV seeding
  from snapshot mounts (gate-12 measured), unprivileged `.zfs` automount minefield — recorded in
  the epic block as the harder-rejected sibling) → Operator proposed the straightforward
  backup-over-live-dataset model (SOUND on zfs: no seed latency, delta sends, honest accounting,
  Finding-B-moot, CoW-free version isolation; costs: re-splits the unified lifecycle — the
  portable exchange model stays the floor for non-snapshotting backends and the qn.6b gate stays
  THEIR answer; `.zfs` browse becomes load-bearing (probe); epic-scale) → ruled ((dn) confirming
  the discussion): does NOT meet the insert bar, home = the multi-storage epic as a first-class
  MODE, with a btrfs-native twin noted for DSM. Nothing pre-freeze changes; the soak + qn.7's
  chaos work feed the mode decision with real evidence.
- 2026-07-25: **pr.3 LANDED — the agent instructions, the six workflow skills, and the layered
  permission allowlist, as three bot-authored PRs reviewed and rebase-merged the same day
  ([#7](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/7) → `637bf06`,
  [#8](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/8) → `52adf48`+`b1d607c`,
  [#6](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/6) → `6df2461`; `main` linear,
  `43136ec..6df2461`). This is the FIRST date-anchored entry: letters
  are retired from here on** — `(a)`–`(do)` stay forever as citations, and new entries cite PR/issue
  numbers, which GitHub allocates race-free. #6 rewrites `CLAUDE.md` into the standing instructions
  (project shape; the forge-as-substrate workflow — fresh clone per unit of work, small PRs with one
  reviewable claim, approver-never-author, the DoD; issue homes; the durable hard rules, now
  including *interface facts and version pins are looked up live, never remembered*; the
  resurrection test). #7 adds `/onboard` (the resurrection test as a command, and the only
  model-invocable one, so "continue quince" self-onboards), `/kickoff`, `/report`, `/review-pr`
  (with `all`), `/land`, and `/qa` — the last a labelled placeholder, since the ruled dev-container
  deploy needs pr.2/pr.4 and inventing a deploy URL is exactly the lie state honesty forbids. #8
  commits the generic allowlist plus the reference environment under convention names only
  (`quince-pve`, `quince-dev-N`), with real addresses binding per-machine in the gitignored local
  layer; denies mirror branch protection and keep credential-file contents out of transcripts. Two
  self-corrections during the build, both from checking instead of remembering: the bot DOES have
  push on this repo (R1's recorded one-repo scope had decayed once the devlog existed), and a
  blanket force-push deny would have fought the routine amend-a-PR-branch flow. **The architect
  review caught one blocking regression that the self-corrections did not**: #6's product-shape
  summary described the pre-qn.5b reflink-*mirror* storage model and carried a stale `work/<job>`
  path plus a "browse never reads the head" line that qn.5b falsified — written by summarising the
  OLD `CLAUDE.md` instead of reading design §5, on the very rung whose thesis is that agents read
  canon. Fixed against §5 as landed (one lifecycle; per-job `working/<udid>` seeded reflink→copy,
  never hardlink; commit = verify → `renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE)` → snapshot/archive; `latest/` as
  both offsite surface and the browse root of the newest version; dirty-working kept on failure;
  seed sentinel; roll-forward) with an explicit §5 citation so the next editor is pointed at the
  source, not the summary. Two rulings folded in during review: **`quince-bot` now has write on
  quince-devlog** (journal entries are implementer output by design, so the journal is part of the
  bot's workspace — `/report`'s access probe absorbs it with no skill change), and the
  suggestion-turned-amendment steering runtime-equipped workstations to move the broad
  docker/nerdctl grants into their local layer. Owed: a cleanup PR here stripping this repo's
  program doc of the retired process loop (worktrees / rsync / commit-when-asked — `CLAUDE.md` wins
  on process meanwhile), Operator-approved since it is architect-authored; the flake filed as
  [quince#9](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/issues/9) (`TestStorySingleFlight` leaves its
  second job running, so `t.TempDir` cleanup races a live writer — found by CI on a docs-only diff,
  deliberately not fixed inside a process PR). Friction notes: nine items in
  [devlog#1](https://github.com/novkostya/quince-devlog/issues/1) — token scope vs `gh pr edit`, the
  decayed access record, the program-doc contradiction, a proposed DoD refinement naming the two
  legitimate non-URL deploy outcomes, identity separation being discipline rather than structure

- 2026-07-26: **pr.2 LANDED — `devct`, the dev-container toolkit, as six bot-authored PRs across one
  night ([#10](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/10) spec →
  [#12](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/12) API core + `doctor` →
  [#13](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/13) `bin/gh-bot` →
  [#14](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/14) template generator →
  [#15](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/15) lifecycle →
  [#16](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/16) onboard + the allowlist swap). A stranger with a
  Proxmox box now runs `devct onboard`, `devct-template build`, `devct create`, and has a container
  that reaches a green gate ladder in ~3 minutes.** The rung's thesis was the spec's token-first
  amendment — attempt everything on the scoped token, take root only where the API demonstrably
  refuses — and the measured verdict is sharper than either side predicted: **the entire permanent
  root surface of the system is one four-command block at `versions.env` cadence.** Create,
  provision, convert, destroy and the whole everyday path are scoped-token; G2 was run from a
  session holding no root path to the hypervisor at all, so "no root" there is structural rather
  than promised, and reproduced independently by the architect (181 s vs 194 s to a green ladder).
  **The privilege model, measured rather than recalled:** `SDN.Use` on the bridge; `Datastore.Audit`
  *and* `AllocateTemplate` on the **vztmpl** storage (downloading a template and consuming one at
  create are different permissions, and neither belongs on the rootfs storage — a zfspool cannot
  hold `vztmpl` at all, which invalidated the first grant and the check that blessed it);
  conversion needs **no additional privilege**; `Pool.Allocate` remains masked-not-measured and is
  labelled as such in the code. **Two things forced root, both discovered by running:** `keyctl` is
  `root@pam` by design, so no ACL can ever grant it; and the Alpine appliance ships no sshd, which
  **falsifies R3's "the box is born reachable"** — born with a key is not born reachable. `pct exec`
  joined the standing root class by Operator ruling (bounded to pool-verified vmids during template
  builds), keeping Alpine everywhere for dev/staging parity. A verified no-root alternative was
  recorded rather than taken: `termproxy` answers 200 on the scoped token. **Interface facts banked:**
  `api_host` must be a name the API certificate carries (`api_addr` binds it via `--resolve`;
  an address there fails verification, and `-k` is mechanically banned by the shell gate); Alpine's
  `buildkit` ships only the daemon, `buildctl` is its own package; the container-to-template flag
  lands asynchronously, so verification polls. **The recurring defect of the rung, worth naming:**
  *a claim printed without checking the thing it claims* — a refusal handler that dropped the API's
  own message, a `done.` after one command of four ran, a verify that failed on a template it had
  just built, an ssh-include write that reported a path it had left empty, and — the sharpest —
  `no root was used.` as an unconditional `printf` on runs where root ran four commands. Each fix
  turned an assertion into a measurement; the last one now generates G1's evidence itself.
  **`make gates-sh` earned its place on its maiden run** (shellcheck + a `curl -k` ban), catching an
  `eval`-based config parser and, later, three separate prose-backtick bugs — one of which was
  *live*, executing `apk info -L buildkit` on the session host from inside an unquoted heredoc.
  **`bin/gh-bot` closed the last escalation class**: `Bash(gh pr *)` was allowlisted yet every
  bot-authored `gh` call still prompted, because an allow rule never matches past a leading
  `VAR=value` — and each escalation lost its result on the way back, which produced one stale
  "still open" claim about work already done. The wrapper opened its own PR as its own proof.
  **Owed, each cheap and each needing architect access:** the `--skip-keyctl` measurement (if the
  toolchain does not need the flag, half the root block disappears), `Pool.Allocate`'s
  revoke-and-retest, registry-credential injection (G4), the stamp-mismatch branch, and a
  systematic POSIX-prefix pass over shell helpers (the shared-namespace clobber was fixed where it
  bit, not eliminated). Next: pr.4 (the `/report` deploy hook, which retires the `/qa` placeholder),
  pr.5 (runner host), pr.6 (lockout).
- 2026-07-26: **pr.4 LANDED — `dev-deploy`: a PR now carries a working demo URL and a walked
  click list without anyone asking, as three PRs
  ([#17](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/17) spec →
  [#18](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/18) the `devct deploy` verb →
  [#19](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/19) `/report` by default, `/qa` replaced, the DoD
  naming both non-URL outcomes).** `devct deploy` fetches a ref onto a disposable dev container,
  builds **the production image** there (QA against a different artifact is QA of something nobody
  ships), serves it in `--demo` mode replacing any previous deploy, and **polls `/api/health` until
  it answers before printing anything**. Measured: **222 s** for a first deploy on a fresh container
  (cold image build), **5 s** for a warm re-deploy. **The URL question was ruled before code
  existed** — R5 wants the URL in the PR, privacy forbids an address in PR text — and the answer is
  the convention name (`http://quince-dev-N:8080/`), which carries no site information and is
  satisfied *by construction* rather than by a reviewer catching a leak. **Amended after the first
  implementation (Operator):** the address the tool prints leads, because on the LAN it needs no
  setup and **`ssh -L` is the one path that does not scale to parallel rungs** — every container has
  its own `8080`, so N deploys are N addresses while N tunnels collide on the local port; the tunnel
  is the address-free fallback for a reader who has the alias but not the LAN, never a requirement.
  **Four defects found by running rather than reading, none of which review would have caught:**
  `ssh -n` — the pr.2 fix for "ssh eats a loop's stdin" — applied to the two calls whose stdin *is*
  the payload, so the remote shell got nothing, exited 0, and the image build silently never
  happened; `localhost` resolving to `::1` past nerdctl's IPv4-only port proxy, which reported a
  dead demo that was serving perfectly **and would have broken the ruled `ssh -L` command from the
  other side**; Alpine's sshd shipping `AllowTcpForwarding no`, so the ruled click path was **broken
  at the daemon on every container** (fixed in the template, and `devct create` retrofits containers
  cloned from an older one, saying which it did); and `SC2087` — an unquoted ssh heredoc expands
  every `$` client-side, which works by luck until the remote script wants a variable. **The rung's
  own signature defect recurred and was promoted to canon:** a container resolver that returned
  empty for both "none running" and "several running", so `deploy` printed *no running dev
  container* while two were up and offered a fix that would have created a third. That is the sixth
  instance across pr.2/pr.4 of **a message naming a condition nobody checked**, and it is now a
  program-doc rule with its four earned corollaries and the test that makes it usable — *could this
  message print unchanged in a situation where it is untrue?*
  ([devlog#5](https://github.com/novkostya/quince-devlog/pull/5)). **G3 made the rung prove itself:**
  #19 carried a URL produced by the machinery, with every click-list line walked
  (`needs_setup` → setup 200 → the demo device with its real model/OS → `POST /api/jobs` 202,
  `auto` resolving to `usb` → job `backing_up` at 52%), and stated plainly that the demo behind it
  is byte-identical to `main`'s because the PR changes no product code — the URL is evidence about
  the *machinery*, not about a change to click. **Owed:** nobody has looked at rendered pixels (every
  step went through the API over a tunnel); `--hosts` is unexercised; `deploy: unavailable —
  <reason>` has never been emitted by a real `/report` run; and pr.2's four measurements still need
  architect access (`--skip-keyctl`, `Pool.Allocate`, registry injection, the stamp-mismatch branch).
  Next: pr.5 (runner host — where this loop stops depending on a laptop staying awake), then pr.6
  (lockout).
- 2026-07-26: **pr.5 CODE LANDED — the runner exists, is provisioned, and reports honestly that it
  is waiting for the one thing no script can do
  ([#21](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/21) spec →
  [#22](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/22) preflight + service + provisioning →
  [#23](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/23) stand it up). The GATES ARE OWED:** G2/G3/G5/G6
  all need a live Remote Control session, which needs the Operator's `claude auth login` — measured,
  not assumed: a `setup-token`/`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` credential **cannot establish Remote
  Control at all** ("requires a full-scope login token"), so the interactive step is the only path
  and there is no headless variant to find. **Re-checking R6 against the live docs before speccing
  confirmed three facts and corrected three**, one of which would have shipped a runner unable to do
  the only thing it exists for: `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` pointing anywhere but `api.anthropic.com`
  disables Remote Control (so the structural guard needed a third assertion R6 never named); the
  token-credential fact above; and a ~10-minute network outage **exits the process**, which makes
  supervision a correctness requirement and means a restart registers a **new** session — agreeing
  with rung-loop's fresh-session resume *by construction* rather than by reconciliation. **Two more
  corrections came from the box rather than the docs:** Alpine ships **OpenRC with no systemd**, so
  the spec's "systemd unit" would have been a file nothing on that host could run (`rc-service`
  present, `systemctl` absent, `supervise-daemon` available); and Alpine is a supported platform
  with a **signed apk repository**, so provisioning verifies the signing key against its published
  checksum and refuses on mismatch instead of `curl | bash`, with `USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP=0` set
  because on musl the bundled ripgrep is unused and its absence surfaces later as search silently
  returning nothing. **The rung's own defect class recurred twice more, both caught by running:**
  `rc-service status` reported `started` while the supervised process crash-looped on *"You must be
  logged in"* — true of the supervisor, false of the question anyone is asking — so the service now
  overrides `status` (supervisor-up-but-NO-SESSION, exit 1; stopped, exit 3); and then the fix for
  that **failed to reach the box it fixed**, because `provision` installs the service from the
  launchpad clone, which tracks `main`. A fix on a branch cannot reach a box on `main`, so
  `provision` now prints `service installed from <sha> (<branch>)` and warns when the installed file
  predates the override. That second one was surfaced by an architect incident worth recording: the
  runner was destroyed by testing its own destroy-guard **from `main`, where the guard does not
  exist** — a mistake that produced a defect nobody would otherwise have found, because nobody
  re-provisions an already-working box. Protocol fix owned by the architect: `/review-pr` must say
  *run the head under review*. **Owed:** the ceremony (`claude auth login`, workspace trust, the two
  `/config` push toggles), then G2 (session reachable from a phone), G3 (restart registers a new
  session — **and count the picker entries before and after**, still unmeasured), G5 (`--force`
  destroy, unexercised because the only instance is the real runner), and G6, which closes the rung:
  an implementer loop run entirely **from** the runner, which is also the moment identity separation
  stops being discipline and becomes the machine. Next: pr.6 (lockout), which now inherits a written
  constraint — the root-capable path reaches the runner **only** as a forced-command wrapper, two
  command shapes, pool-verified, never a general root key.
- 2026-07-26: **The architect gets its own box, and the loop gets its event source — six PRs after
  pr.5's first three ([quince#25](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/25) spec,
  [#26](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/26) the arch role,
  [#27](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/27) tag-based guards,
  [#29](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/29) `gh-arch`,
  [#30](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/30) spec drift, and
  [#28](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/28) `forge-watch` for
  [devlog#4](https://github.com/novkostya/quince-devlog/issues/4)). Both boxes exist and refuse each
  other's identity; the ceremony is still the only thing left in pr.5.** [devlog#7](https://github.com/novkostya/quince-devlog/issues/7)'s
  finding was a boundary rather than a symmetry: pr.5's win is that the *implementer* identity
  becomes structural by living on a machine, and an architect session needs a credential that can
  **approve** — one box holding both means `approver ≠ author` degrades from a property into a
  convention about which token a session picks up. **The mechanism is an inversion:** `preflight`
  asserts the bot token is PRESENT on the runner and ABSENT on `quince-arch`, enforced where the
  service starts rather than where someone provisioned it, and proven by the refusal (a planted
  token → exit 1) rather than by the pass. `devct create --role arch` injects nothing;
  `devct destroy` protects persistent boxes by a **PVE tag** rather than a hard-coded name, because
  a name list drifts the moment a third box exists and reading a role over ssh fails exactly when a
  box is down — which is when a destroy is most likely to be the mistake. **Defects found by
  running, several inside the mechanism built to prevent them:** `create` injected the bot token
  onto the arch box and that box's own preflight refused to start (the guard worked, the path
  feeding it did not); the drift reporter added one PR earlier **invented drift**, announcing a
  newer version on a box already ahead of it, so the comparison now belongs to `apk`, which owns the
  version scheme; the first destroy guard protected *everything*, including disposable containers,
  because role and persistence are different axes I had conflated; and `forge-watch`'s truncation
  warning fired **every tick**, which is the silent cap re-created through boredom — a consumer
  learns to filter an unconditional warning, so it now fires only when the window's oldest row is
  still open. **`forge-watch` itself is a pure `step(state, observation) → events` with a thin
  fetch**, which is what finally makes a monitor testable: five fixtures, including the two recorded
  regressions from the night the monitors failed. Its own worst bug was the class it exists to
  prevent — a failed fetch was indistinguishable from a legitimate observation, because piping `gh`
  into `jq` yields *jq's* exit status, so a missing wrapper emitted `first-observation count=`
  forever while looking healthy. It now emits `fetch-failed` with a reason and writes no state.
  **Also fixed: the specs named a service manager the boxes do not have** — six places across two
  specs still said systemd after the build correctly landed OpenRC, including a gate telling a
  reader to run `systemctl status` on a host without it, and rung-loop's supervision design, which
  would have reached code. **Owed:** the ceremony (both boxes, one sitting), then G2/G3/G6/G8/G9;
  pr.0b is ruled and the arch credential is placed; [quince#31](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/issues/31)
  records a second timing flake, proven by the same commit failing and passing.

- 2026-07-26: **The revamp's session hosts are live, and the ceremony taught three gates the docs
  did not have.** Both boxes hold Remote Control sessions: `quince-runner` (implementer) and
  `quince-arch` (architect), each refusing the other's credential at service start. The Operator's
  login worked first time; everything that *looked* like an auth failure was a later gate —
  a respawning service fighting the interactive login, workspace trust presented by the TUI as a
  sign-in screen (auth was provably fine: `claude -p` answered from that same directory), and a
  one-time `Enable Remote Control? (y/n)` consent that a supervised daemon can never answer (it
  persists once accepted). All three are filed as
  [#33](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/issues/33). Completing the second box also found a real
  bug — [#32](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/issues/32): `provision --role arch` writes the
  role to conf.d but the init script never exports it, so preflight ran as the default role and
  demanded the bot token that box must never hold. Every component was correct; nothing told
  preflight what kind of box it was on, and the arch path had never been exercised. A temporary
  export is in place on that box and must be removed by the fix.

  [#33](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/issues/33),
  [devlog#10](https://github.com/novkostya/quince-devlog/issues/10))

- 2026-07-26: **The public docs stopped reading as a lab journal, and no decision left with the
  voice.** [quince#11](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/issues/11) part 1, in two slices. The
  README's status line and **Why** now address a visitor instead of the project — process-speak
  ("hardware-proven", "under real daily use") became what works, on what, and what is still
  missing, and the first Why bullet stopped being anchored on one maintainer's history with a
  desktop app over SMB ([quince#39](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/39)). The canon docs
  state their reasons without citing a maintainer's homelab as design authority
  ([quince#42](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/pull/42)): `ui.design.md`'s `Taste references
  (Operator-supplied)` became a `Visual target` section describing the QUALITIES the named apps
  stood for, and stack.md's four framing spots — the lab-journal intro, D1's family argument,
  D5a's motivating case, D12's litmus test — lost the person and kept the argument. **The bar
  ("re-voice, never delete") caught two things the diff would not have:** every concrete spec the
  taste-reference list carried had to move into the qualities, because §4 and the Conventions
  gloss both point at that list; and `mercury` was DEFINED only in the bullet that went away
  while stack D7 still cites it as the `@mercury-fx/ui`-not-consumed record, so D7 took the gloss
  and keeps the name. Kept deliberately: the role-noun citations ("Operator ruling", "the
  Operator's lab box" for a non-CI gate), which name who decided and who owns a gate. Part 2 —
  the public README with screenshots and quickstart — stays with qn.6 per the issue's own ruling.
  **The privacy sweep is the one gate an implementer session cannot run here:** no private layer
  on the box, so `make privacy-check` exits 0 having grepped nothing, both PRs shipped with that
  box unticked and the sweep declared, and the supervisor ran it from the host that holds the
  pattern list. Filed rather than folded in:
  [quince#40](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/issues/40) — stack.md still tells an agent a
  decision is reopened by "the Operator saying so in chat", a channel that stopped carrying
  authority at `pr.0`.

- 2026-07-26: **Both `internal/backup` flakes fixed test-only and CI-proven — and the load that
  reproduces them surfaced a third finding that is not a flake at all.** The two open flake issues
  turned out to be one class each, and neither published fix shape was quite right.
  [quince#9](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/issues/9): `TestStorySingleFlight` leaves a second
  device's job running, and **waiting for that job would not have closed it** — `run()` emits the
  terminal row, THEN discards `working/`, and only frees the per-UDID slot on its way out, so
  terminal state is not the quiescence signal. The file already half-knew this: `startWhenReleased`
  carries a note about "the brief single-flight window between a job's terminal row and the release
  of its per-UDID slot". So the fix went into the harness — cancel every live job, wait for
  `e.running` to empty, fail loudly if it will not — which closes the class for every test in the
  package rather than the one instance. Reproduced at `-count 50` on the first attempt; green at 50,
  at 100 under CPU contention, and the package at `-count 5`.
  [quince#31](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/issues/31): **not reproduced**, and the entry says
  so — the CI load profile reproduces exactly (`deviceops` 34 s, `httpapi` 17 s, the issue's own
  numbers) but the package finished in 9 s and the named test passed 20/20 at 3× oversubscription,
  so the spawn-latency hypothesis is unconfirmed and that one red run remains the only evidence. The
  category was fixed anyway: `waitTerminal`/`waitState` now read their duration as a **no-progress
  window** rather than a wall-clock budget, restarting whenever the job visibly advances. That is
  **stronger, not merely more tolerant** — an engine taking 30 s to notice a dead transport used to
  pass a 60 s budget and now fails, which is what raising the constants would have given up. ~30
  budgets across the package keep their numbers and simply mean something better; failures now report
  `phase`/`liveness` beside `state`, since `state=backing_up` alone never said whether the job was
  progressing. Proven negatively too: a deliberately wedged job (tool hanging, liveness timeout
  pushed out so the engine will not kill it) still fails in ~the window, naming what it saw.
  **The third finding is a product bug: [quince#35](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/issues/35).**
  Under load `TestStoryCancel` fails `state=failed, want cancelled` ~25% of runs. `CancelJob` cancels
  the job context, `cmd.Start()` then fails with `context canceled`, and `supervise` returns
  `outcomeProcErr` **without consulting `killReason`** — so a user who presses Cancel is told the
  backup *failed*, quoting an internal context. The engine checks kill-reason-first in both
  `awaitDevice` and `runToolLoop`; this one path skips it. Filed, not fixed: product code under
  freeze, and folding it into a test-only branch is the scope creep the process forbids. **Owed:**
  architect review of both PRs; a ruling on #35; and a real privacy sweep — the runner has no
  `local/privacy-patterns.txt`, so `make privacy-check` printed *skipped*, not *clean*, and both PRs
  leave that checklist box unticked with the gap named rather than papered over. **Process note:**
  #9 was reserved as the first *post-freeze* item and the four owed unfreeze items
  ([quince#32](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/issues/32),
  [quince#33](https://github.com/novkostya/quince/issues/33), `pr.6`,
  [devlog#4](https://github.com/novkostya/quince-devlog/issues/4)) are all still open — this ran on
  the Operator's explicit instruction, under the soak-maintenance lane that (dd)/(di) established for
  test-only work, and the record should show the ordering was overridden rather than met.
